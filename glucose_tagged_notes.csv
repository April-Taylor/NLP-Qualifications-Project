Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Increased Ostomy Output, nausea/vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular triple lumen catheter placement,
revision, and replacement by Interventional Radiology
1 unit packed red blood cell transfusion


History of Present Illness:
34 yo F with pmhx significant for Crohn's disease s/p near-total
colectomy and ileostomy, PE/UE DVT on lovenox with recent
hospitalization [**2196-6-3**] - [**2196-6-18**] for stomal pain and found to
have fungemia/bacteremia now s/p portacath removal who presents
to the ED with persistent stomal pain, increased stool output
and nausea/vomiting.
.
Patient was last admitted from [**Date range (3) 110642**] for abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased ostomy output. During that
admission she underwent ileoscopy, endoscopy and flexible
sigmoidoscopy which were normal and showed no signs of active
crohns; infectious work-up was negative and MRE was unrevealing.
Inflammatory markers were normal and her steroids were tapered
(initially started on methylprednisolone 20 iv q8h for presumed
crohns flare), which she finished on [**2196-6-20**]. Colorectal
surgery thought patient had a stomal prolapse however should not
be causing the degree of pain she reported.  Ultimately thought
that the pain was due to irritation of the stoma due to
increased stool output.  Patient offered reversal of ostomy and
has appointment on [**2196-7-7**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 **] to
discuss (wanted infection to clear prior to OR).  Patient
started on loperamide to decrease stool output.  Blood cultures
during that admission grew Staph epidermidis as well as [**Female First Name (un) 564**],
and she was started on a course of Linezolid and Fluconazole;
Linezolid was planned to be finished on [**2196-6-26**] (although
patient finished yesterday) and Fluconazole on [**2196-6-28**] (still
taking). Patient's portacath was removed and a right IJ TLC was
placed for acess during the remainder of her hospital stay.
Patient has very poor access and has required multiple
portacaths.  Found to have a RUE axillary and left IJ DVT for
which she is managed with lovenox, reportedly non-compliant as
an outpatient (although denies this).  While awaiting insurance
authorization of Linezolid she left against medical advice,
however obtained prior auth as an outpatient.

Since discharge, the patient reports that she has continued to
have stomal pain, worse with passage of stool.  Pain describd as
burning/pressure pain.  Also with increased stool output, watery
without any visible blood although reportedly guaiac positive at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] per patient.  Patient finished her prednisone taper on
[**2196-6-20**] with no change in symptoms.  Also with one day of
nausea/vomiting, unable to take po.  Denies any fever, chills,
cp or sob.
.
ED: initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] ED where a small piv was
placed and patient given 500 cc of NS until iv access lost.
Given po zofran and IM dilaudid.  Labs drawn and significant for
normal wbc's, sodium 133 and K+ 3.1.  No LFTs drawn.  Patient
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Vitals: 98.8  108P  107/61  16  99%RA.
Given zofran 4mg ODT x 2 and dilaudid 1mg IM.

[**6-26**] CXR:

IMPRESSION:  Persistent unusual medial course of right internal
jugular
central venous catheter, which courses more medially than a
previous right
internal jugular venous catheter present on prior chest x-rays
and CT scans in
[**2196-5-15**].  Position on lateral view excludes internal mammary
vein location
and suggests a central venous location, but inadvertent arterial
placement
cannot be excluded.
.
KUB [**6-27**]:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
.
[**6-27**] MRI chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal areas of thrombosis within the venous system of
the upper
extremities bilaterally including near total occlusion of the
SVC and left brachiocephalic vein by thrombus, and non-occlusive
thrombus in the right internal jugular and at the junction of
the right internal jugular and subclavian veins on the right.
Left internal jugular vein is completely occluded, with numerous
collaterals visualized.
2.  2.5 x 1.6 cm retropharyngeal fluid collection in the
cervical spine,
concerning for reaccumulation of the patient's prior abscess.
Re-evaluation with dedicated MR of the neck with contrast is
recommended.
3.  3.3 x 1.9 cm subcutaneous hyperintense area relative to
skeletal muscle on [**Name (NI) 91308**] images in the region of the prior
placement of the port, presumed to be a hematoma.
The pertinent findings were discussed Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the
covering
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] telephone at 5:30 p.m. on [**2196-6-27**].
.
[**6-28**] RUQ u/s:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic ductal
dilatation to
suggest cholestasis.
.
[**6-29**] replacement of TLC:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Uncomplicated SVC gram demonstrating near-complete occlusion
of the mid to lower SVC, non-occlusive thrombus extending into
the left brachiocephalic vein, multiple venous collaterals.
2.  Uncomplicated replacement of the old 7 French 15 cm
triple-lumen central venous catheter with a new 7 French 20-cm
triple-lumen central venous catheter, with its tip in the upper
right atrium.  Catheter is ready for use.
.
[**7-4**] MRI c-spine:
IMPRESSION:  Study is quite limited by motion artifact, but
demonstrates:
1.  Ill-defined fusiform fluid/edema in the prevertebral space,
extending from
the C1 through C7 level.  This is, overall, less marked than on
the previous
MR study of [**2196-5-17**] and demonstrates no definite rim- or
internal enhancement
to suggest true collection or abscess.
2.  No finding to suggest spondylodiscitis or its complications,
such as
epidural phlegmon or abscess.
3.  Normal cervical spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal
intensity.
.
COMMENT:  These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
([**Hospital1 18**]
hospitalist, covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**], the requesting
clinician) via
telephone, at 1745 H on [**2196-7-3**].  Apparently, the patient has
known ""SVC syndrome"" with documented venous thrombosis, over the
entire time period dating to early [**Month (only) 547**], which likely accounts
for the persistent retropharyngeal/prevertebral edema.
As discussed, in this setting, the role of continued dedicated
imaging of the cervical spine and soft tissues is unclear.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**7-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of obstruction or abscess.  Stranding around
ileostomy is
unchanged since [**2196-5-29**] and is likely chronic.
2.  Simple free fluid within the pelvis.
3.  Hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver, too small to
characterize, most likely a cyst.
4.  Multiple collateral vessels in the right subcutaneous
tissues which
correlates with patient's history of known bilateral IJ and
subclavian
occlusion
.
[**7-5**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-6-14**],
findings are similar.
.
[**7-7**] R/IJ:
CONCLUSION:
1.  Placement of a triple-lumen central venous line into the
right atrium over the guide wire through the existing access in
the right internal jugular vein.
2.  The line is ready to use.
.
[**7-10**] KUB:
Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.  There is air and stool seen
throughout colon.  No dilated loops of small bowel are
identified.  Bony structures are intact.  There is no free
intra-abdominal gas seen on the left side downdecubitus
radiographs.
.
[**7-11**] MRI necK:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Ill-defined fluid/edema in the prevertebral spaces from
C1-C7 is
significantly decreased since the prior exam.  No evidence of
abnormal
enhancement.
2.  Stable degenerative changes of the cervical spine, and mild
downward
displacement of the cerebellar tonsils.

Brief Hospital Course:
## Venous thrombosis/SVC syndrome: MRV showed large amount of
clot burden in upper central venous system with total occlusion
of left IJ and subtotal occlusion of the right IJ and SVC.  She
was on Lovenox at home and was transitioned to a heparin gtt
this admission.  Given her difficult access, a right IJ was
placed by the MICU attending on the floor prior to transfer.
This was changed for a longer 20cm line by IR while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
and was functioning well at the time of transfer.  The etiology
of her extensive clotting was thought to be a combination of
hypercoagulability from her Crohn's, endothelial damage from her
multiple prior ports and potentially a familial thrombophilia.
Heme/onc was consulted regarding her extensive thrombus and
recommended continuing heparin drip while in house with plans to
transition to coumadin WHILE BRIDGING FOR A MINIMUM OF 48HRS. In
addition, should the patient become subtherapeutic ever, she
WILL REQUIRE REBRIDGING WITH IV HEPARIN OR LOVENOX AT 100MG [**Hospital1 **].
IR is planning to take her for angioplasty, kissing stent
placement, and port placement for a planned admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
the day after her IV antibiotic course is complete (see below).
The vascular service was consulted, however, the team felt that
there was no current indication for thrombectomy and no
procedures should be performed until either the patient has been
line free x1 month or at least until after her abx course is
complete. She will need to be transitioned back to either
lovenox or IV heparin prior to her IR admission. As all of the
thromboses have been line-related, the Hematology service did
not recommend ordering a hypercoagulable work-up, although this
may be considered at a later date given the history of
thrombophilia in her mother and brother. The hematology service
will be following up with the patient in about 3weeks after
discharge.
-STARTING COUMADIN 5MG ON [**7-14**]. SHE HAS BEEN ON A CONTINUOUS IV
HEPARIN INFUSION. SHE WILL NEED TO BE BRIDGED FOR AT LEAST 48HRS
WHILE THERAPEUTIC. SHOULD ABSORPTION OR RECURRENT N/V BECOME AN
ISSUE OR PT IS TO BECOME SUBTHERAPEUTIC, SHE WILL NEED TO BE
BRIDGED WITH IV HEPARIN OR LOVENOX 100MG [**Hospital1 **]. SHOULD ABSORPTION
BECOME A RECURRENT ISSUE, PT SHOULD THEN BE PLACED ON LOVENOX
100MG [**Hospital1 **] WITH A FACTOR 10A LEVEL TO BE CHECKED AFTER 3RD DOSE.
.
## access issues-pt has very complicated vascular access. See
above. There was much debate among the vascular service, IR,
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (line specialist), and ID as what would be the
best approach for the patient. There was some consideration of
removing the pt's R.IJ (that has been changed over a wire twice)
and placing temporary, possibly tunneled, groin access. However,
this was felt to place the patient at high risk for infection
given her prior infections and prolonged planned course of IV
abx. In addition, should she clot groin access, she will be left
in a difficult place as she no longer has any upper extremity
access (other than R.IJ above).Therefore, it was decided to keep
her current temporary R.IJ in place while continuing antibiotic
therapy and anticoagulation. Then, the patient is to return for
a scheduled admission to [**Hospital1 18**] the day after her antibiotics are
complete ([**2196-8-5**] or [**2196-8-8**]) for an IR procedure to place
kissing stents, angioplasty and for port placement.
.
## High-grade Enterobacter bacteremia: Patient developed
worsening abdominal pain and fevers. Blood cultures grew
pan-sensitive Enterobacter. Started on Zosyn but was
persistently bacteremic. Thus, the ID service recommended
switching to Meropenem for better clot penetration as there was
concern of superinfected thrombosis. (there is no plan for
thrombectomy/intervention at this time) At that time, the
original internal jugular catheter was exchanged over a wire.
THis was then performed a second time. The first negative blood
culture after these measures were taken was [**2196-7-8**]. Surface
ECHO was negative for vegetations. CT abdomen was unremarkable
for intraabdominal fluid collection to suggest a GI source. The
ID team followed the patient closely during admission. The ID
team has recommended 4 weeks of IV meropenem. Pt should have
weekly safetly labs (cbc with diff, chem 7, LFTs) while on
meropenem. Pt should have a repeat blood culture with gram stain
the day the antibiotics are to be completed. Last day of therapy
for 4 week course is [**2196-8-5**]. PT WILL NEED REPEAT BCX AND GRAM
STAIN DAY ABX COURSE IS COMPLETE.

## Retropharyngeal fluid collection on MRI: Concern for abscess.
 ENT/IR felt this was a reaccumulation of a previous hematoma
from port placement and thought that instrumentation to that
area could introduce infection.  With no fevers/leukocytosis it
was decided to have repeat neck imaging which showed a decrease
in the size of the fluid collection.

## Elevated LFTs: RUQ was unremarkable and her LFTs were stable,
it was thought to be [**3-17**] her recent antifungals.  Hep B showed
immunization, Hep C was negative.

## Stomal pain/increased stool output: She had an extensive
work-up for her stoma pain and high ostomy output last
admission, all of which was negative, with no evidence for an
active Crohn's flare. Surgery was consulted but did not feel
that an ostomy take down was indicated at this time. Pt is under
the assumption that she can be considered for take down after
her acute medical issues have resolved.  GI was following and
did not have any further recommendations.
-pain regimen includes gabapentin, lidocaine patch, PO dilaudid
prn. Of note, pt reports pain at times despite the regimen.
There was concern at one point during her hospitalization that
she was tampering with her infusion of IV dilaudid, as they are
hung in a minibag and not pushed. She has periods of ""Stoma""
pain with n/v that seem to be cyclical in nature and last for a
few days then resolve without intervention. During periods of
quiescence she does not require any pain medication. Zofran and
compazine were given for nausea. Pt was started on gabapentin
and a lidocaine patch.
.
## Prior [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia, Staph epidermidis bacteremia: per
discharge summary patient was to continue linezolid for 10 days
after port removal which was [**2196-6-24**] (port removed [**2196-6-15**]) and
fluconazole for 14 days after port removal until [**2196-6-28**]. She
was switched to Micafungin through the end of her course given
LFT abnormalities. Courses complete.

## Anemia: microcytic, hct within baseline, no brbpr or melena
but guaiac + stool at [**Hospital1 **] per patient.  Hct initially 37, but
dropped to 23 with hydration which was previous baseline. Given
1U PRBC transfusion for Hct 19 but not actively bleeding at that
time. HCT was 22.3 on the day of DC. Further work up can be
pursued in the outpatient setting.

## Sinus tach: HR mostly in the 90-110s, which is chronic and
likely due to her extensive clot burden. Resolved.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Baby Girl [**Known lastname 4068**] is a 36 1/7 weeks 2605 gm female newborn who
was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for
management of possible small bowel obstruction.

This infant was born to a 34 year old gravida 3, para 2
mother.  Prenatal screens, blood type A positive, antibody
negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR
nonreactive, Rubella immune, Group B Streptococcus status
unknown.  This pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios
and suspected duodenal atresia.  Mother was transferred from
[**Name (NI) 41498**] Hospital to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further evaluation.  A fetal scan at [**Hospital6 649**] showed multiple distal dilated small bowel
loops consistent with jejunal atresia.  The biophysical
profile was eight out of eight, nonstress test reactive.
Amniocentesis was performed for fetal lung maturity (47) and
cytogenetics.

Socially, the family is intact.  Mother lives with husband.
Two other children born at full term, both are alive and well
([**2188**], [**2190**]).

Rupture of membranes with clear fluid, about 22 hours prior
to delivery.  No maternal fever.  Intrapartum antibiotics
were started 18 hours prior to delivery.  The infant was
delivered under epidural anesthesia.  This was a vaginal
delivery with a facial presentation.  Infant was vigorous
with spontaneous cry.  She was dried and received bulb
suction, stimulation and provided brief blow-by oxygen.  Apgar
scores were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes of age.
The infant was shown to the parents and then transferred to
the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 2,605 gm,
length 49.5 cm, head circumference 33.5 cm.  Vital signs,
temperature 98.4 rectally, heartrate 166, respiratory rate
44, blood pressure 75/36 with a mean arterial pressure of 47
and oxygen saturation in room air 95%.  Dipstick on admission
64.  Infant alert, pink, nondysmorphic.  Anterior fontanelle
was soft and flat.  Positive frontal bossing and forehead
bruising, both most likely related to fetal positioning and
presentation.  Normal-set ears, left lobe with lobe cleft.
Palate intact.  Neck supple without lesions.  Lungs slightly
coarse but good aeration bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate
and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur was auscultated.
+2 femoral pulses bilaterally.  Abdomen soft and flat.  None
to minimal bowel sounds.  Normal preterm female genitalia.
Patent anus.  No sacral anomalies.  Hip lax with bilateral
clicks, yet negative Ortolani and Barlow.  Extremities, pink
and well perfused.  Still with some acrocyanosis.  Tone,
strength and movements normal and symmetrical.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - The infant in room air not
requiring any oxygen, oxygen saturations consistently greater
than 95% on room air.  Breathsounds clear and equal.

Cardiovascular - A murmur was auscultated, the blood pressure
has been stable for duration of hospitalization.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Upon admission to the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit intravenous fluids of D10/W were
initiated at 80 cc/kg/day.  A KUB was performed shortly after
admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit showing a
gastric bubble and minimal distal air.  A nasogastric tube
was placed shortly after admission to the Newborn Intensive
Care Unit and putting out large amounts of clear gastric
contents.  Minimal abdominal distention.

Hematology - Hematocrit 45.1, infant has not received any
blood products during his brief hospitalization.

Infectious disease - Complete blood count with differential
and blood cultures were drawn upon admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.  White blood cell count was 16.8,
hematocrit 45 with 57% neutrophils and 2% bands and a
platelet count of 332.  Blood culture was drawn as well and
is pending.

Neurology - Head ultrasound not indicated at this time.

Sensory - Hearing screen has not yet been performed.

Baby medications were given, Vitamin K and Erythromycin eye
ointment were administered shortly after admission to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and initial PKU was drawn at
less than 24 hours of age.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable in room air.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital3 **] via ambulance,
name of primary pediatrician, [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5395**], phone

30, 158 pO2, 24 bicarbonate.

Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and no major
changes noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 74 year old male with a history
of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, status post open
reduction and internal fixation for left trochanteric
fracture, coronary artery disease, chronic renal
insufficiency who presented with worsening shortness of
breath times one day and was also noted to be febrile to 102
on admission.  Etiology of his shortness of breath was
concerning given his congestive heart failure history and
cardiac versus pulmonary secondary to pneumonia as such.

Cardiac - Coronaries, cycled enzymes were negative and he was
ruled out.  He was continued on Aspirin, beta blocker and
Amlodipine.  Pump, he was given Lasix for diuresis which was
able to get extubated without any difficulty and he was
weaned off oxygen, now down to 2 liters, started two days
before discharge and starting to have increased wheezing.  He
was started on nebulizers which seemed to help but also
decreased urinary output most likely to fluid overload, so on
the day before his discharge his Hydralazine was increased to
75 q.i.d. and he was started on a nesiritide to better
perfuse the kidneys since his creatinines were bumping and
also to decrease his afterloads.  His goals the day before
discharge was 1 liter negative and he has been followed with
daily weights.

Blood pressure - He is normal sinus rhythm, he has history of
intermittent atrial fibrillation.  Since admission he is on
Amiodarone and beta blocker for now and continuing to be
checked on Telemetry.

Pulmonary - The day before discharge he was initially
extubated without any difficulty and weaned off of the oxygen
without any difficulty.  On the day before discharge he was
on 2 liters of oxygen but continued to have extreme wheezing,
bilaterally diffuse and he was started on scheduled
nebulizers which helped the patient and will continue with
the nebulizers when discharged to the rehabilitation center.
He was also started on nesiritide for afterload reduce and
perfuse kidney further which decrease in volume overload will
help his pulmonary status.

Infectious disease - He has been afebrile since admission.
He had a temperature of 102 but has not had one since.  He
was started on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and to
continue a 14 day course.  He has been on day #4 now and is
to continue ten more days upon discharge to rehabilitation.

Neurology - He has baseline dementia of unknown etiology,
questionable.  He is alert and oriented intermittently.
Questionable if dementia secondary to a current metabolic
disorder or his baseline or new baseline.  Neurology will
follow closely and Neurology recommended it is most likely
secondary to metabolic disorder, partially secondary to his
baseline now.

Renal - In terms of his renal status he now has an acute
renal failure secondary to his chronic renal insufficiency.
His baseline creatinine is about mid 2s to .5, now he is
bumped up to 4s and this is most likely secondary to Lasix,
possibly decreased volume to his kidneys.  He is started on a
nesiritide data before discharge to better perfuse the
kidneys, also Renal Consult Service was consulted to put in
their input.  Their input was appreciated.  Will continue to
follow his creatinine closely.  He may need hemodialysis at
some point.

Endocrine - For his diabetes he was continued on his fixed
dose of insulin and also regular insulin sliding scale with a
q.i.d. fingerstick glucose.

Diet - For his diet he was being repleted for his
electrolytes prn.  He was kept on a cardiac, renal and
diabetic diet.

Prophylaxis - Prophylactically he was given proton pump
inhibitor, bowel regimen and heparin subcutaneously.  He did
well and was in stable condition upon discharge to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was discharged to rehabilitation
center.  The patient was instructed to follow weights daily
and to call his medical doctor if his weight had increased
more than 3 pounds and to adhere to a 2 gm sodium diet very
strictly and also a fluid-restricted diet and to seek medical
attention as needed if new symptoms or old symptoms return.
He was also to follow up with his primary care physician
early next week, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25154**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure, no major surgical
invasive procedures done except intubation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 times two, 162 mg q.d.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old gentleman with COPD and depression,
who presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia after not
taking his medication in the setting of family trauma.

# COPD Exacerbation:
Patient presented with COPD exacerbation to the MICU.  He was
given a dose of IV solumedrol, then converted to PO prednisone
60mg, to be tapered over 5 days.  He was also started on a 5d
course of Azithromcyin. He was continued on nebulizers and
inhaled steroids.  He will need PFTs as an outpatient, as he has
never had these before. Pt improved clinically (was weaned off
O2 supplementation) and was discharged with ambulatory sats in
90-92% range.

# Bipolar hx:
Patient is followed by psychiatrist as oupatient. Patient denies
suicidal ideations, though is very emotional about social
situation. Pt was continued on home Lamotrigine and PRN Ativan.

# Tobacco use:
Patient continues to smoke.  He was on nicotine patch during
hospitalization.

# EtOH use:
Per pt, last drink was 3 days ago.  Pt was monitored for signs
of withdrawal, of which he had none.  Pt was given MVI,
thiamine, folate and counseled extensively on cessation.

# Social situation:
Patient's daughter was in critical condition in Trauma ICU.  He
admitted to depression but denied suicidal ideation.

# Screening for prostate cancer:
Patient requests PSA check and will need PSA check as
outpatient, as his father passed away from prostate cancer at
age 59.

# Leukocytosis:
Of unclear etiology, negative infectious workup. Pt was
afebrile.  No indication for antibiotics.

# DM2:
Patient reports being diet controlled for three years,
exacerbated by zyprexa in the past. Pt was on a diabetic diet,
maintained on an insulin sliding scale, especially since being
on steroids. His HbA1C was in good range during this
hospitalizaiton. In setting of diabetic history, patient should
get lipids checked as an outpatient and may benefit from
starting baby aspirin daily.

# RUQ tenderness:
Patient has long drinking history, no complaints of abdominal
pain, though reports RUQ tenderness on exam.  Complains of
significant intermittent RUQ pain after drinking, lasting only a
few seconds. LFTs were in normal range.  Pt needs to be
monitored periodically.

# Patient was on a diabetic diet.  Pt was on SC Heparin for DVT
ppx.  Pt was full code.

Discharge Diagnosis:
COPD Exacerbation


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having a COPD
exacerbation.  You were started on prednisone pills to help
decrease the inflammation in your lungs, which will make you
feel better.  The prednisone will be tapered, as directed below.
 You were also started on an antibiotic, which yo ucan continue
to take at home as directed below.  Finally, it is important
that you continue to take your inhalers as prescribed.  Please
keep your follow-up appointment with your primary care doctor as
shown below, as you may need a referral to a pulmonologist for
further treatment and monitoring of your COPD.

As we discussed, you have a predisposition towards diabetes, and
the prednisone can increase your blood sugars. It is important
that you keep with the diabetic diet, not just cutting back on
sugars but also cutting back on starches such as potatoes.

Please remember to have your PSA drawn at your primary care
doctor's office to screen for prostate cancer, as you were
planning on doing, because you have a strong family history.

You have been through a very difficult time.  Please call your
doctor or return to the ED if you ever have any thoughts of
hurting yourself.  Also, seek immediate medical attention if you
have fevers, increased shortness of breath, wheezing, productive
cough or any other concerning symptoms.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

- Please START taking prednisone 60mg x 1 day, then 40mg x 2
days, then 20mg x 2 days, then stop
- Please START taking azithromycin 250mg x 2 days
- Please start Nicotine Patch daily
- Please start Thiamine 100 mg daily
- Please start Folic Acid  1 mg daily
- Please start Multivitamin daily
- Continue your other home medications as before including
inhalers

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
male with a history of upper GI bleed, acute renal failure,
who was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 1444**] in early [**Month (only) 956**] with an
upper GI bleed.  At this point he was found to have a
superior mesenteric artery aneurysm as well as gastric
duodenal artery bleed.  The gastric duodenal artery was
embolized.  The patient presents on [**2-20**] with abdominal pain,
it was intermittent sharp and dull abdominal pain.  He went
to the [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency Room and was transferred to
the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 69**]
where he was found to have decreased white cells, stable
hematocrit and LFTs were improving from his previous
admission.  Abdominal CT in the Emergency Room showed
decreased hematoma compared to prior CT as well as some
pericholecystic fluid.  Surgical team was consulted.  Patient
was admitted to the hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for spontaneous
pneumothorax, immune complex glomerulonephritis, acute renal
failure, peptic ulcer disease, SMA aneurysm with
retroperitoneal hematoma, [**2151-1-29**] pneumonia, [**2151-1-29**]
increased bilirubin with biliary sludge, status post
percutaneous stent in [**2151-1-29**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**].
Fluid overload with echo, EF greater than 55% and history of
narcotic addiction and paranoia.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Lipitor, Lasix, Protonix,

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Aspirin, Naproxen.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with wife, denies any alcohol, smoking
history up until his [**2151-1-29**] admission.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals on admission were 97.9, blood
pressure 150/80, pulse 88, 91% on room air, respirations 18.
He was fatigued and mildly uncomfortable, alert and oriented
times three.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  HEENT exam was otherwise unremarkable.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Chest showed
slightly decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases,
otherwise clear.  Heart was regular without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  GI showed positive epigastric and right upper
quadrant tenderness, no guarding, slight rebound tenderness
in the epigastrium.  There are bowel sounds present.  Abdomen
was soft, guaiac positive.  Extremities showed 2+ edema
bilaterally.  Neuro, cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Upper extremities and lower extremities showing [**5-2**]
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 138, potassium 3.3,
chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 92,
white count 13 down from 16 upon discharge, hematocrit 26
down from 28.2.  Platelet count 622,000, MCV 89, 78%
neutrophils, 12% lymphs.  ALT, AST were 27 and 27, alkaline
phosphatase 365, total bilirubin 1.7, lipase 132, albumin
1.8, calcium 7.9, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.4.  Urinalysis
showed [**3-2**] white cells, otherwise within normal limits.
Chest x-ray showed improved alveolar pattern, question of
left lower lobe atelectasis vs consolidation as well as small
bilateral pleural effusion.  Abdominal CT showed gallbladder
with minimal pericholecystic fluid, pancreas is unremarkable.
Hematoma 8?????? by 5.5 cm slightly decreased from discharge in
mid [**Month (only) 956**], slight thickening adjacent to colon.  His stent
in his common bile duct with associated pneumobilia.  This
was a contrast negative CT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GI:  Patient was taken to the OR for concern over a
re-bleed of his SMA aneurysm.  This was unable to be fixed by
the vascular surgery service.  Based on its proximity to the
pancreas, the patient subsequently underwent SMA artery
aneurysm on [**2-22**] with interventional radiology service.
Other GI issues during this admission were the presence of
the two biliary stents by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19731**]
was aware of his prolonged hospital course and planned to
remove the two some time during the patient's upcoming
rehabilitation stay.  Patient had a PEG tube placed on [**3-23**]
and was tolerating tube feeds.  At the time of discharge he
was also beginning to tolerate solid po intake with only
intermittent vomiting.  Pancreatic enzymes which had been
elevated earlier in the hospital course came down to normal
at the time of discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was in the SICU with poorly
controlled hypertension from [**2-20**] to [**3-8**] and was started on
Labetalol as well as Captopril and Isordil and Lasix.  In mid
[**Month (only) 958**] the patient had an EKG which showed diffuse T wave
inversion.  The patient's enzymes were cycled and he ruled
out for MI.  Shortly thereafter chest x-ray showed congestive
heart failure and patient was diuresed and his respiratory
status improved but echocardiogram at that point showed a
decrease in his EF from 55% in early [**2151-1-29**] to 20-25% in
mid [**2151-2-26**] with multiple wall motion abnormalities in the
left anterior descending artery territory.  On approximately
[**3-24**] to [**3-25**] the patient's blood pressure began to rise again
and was treated with Labetalol, Captopril.  A repeat echo on
[**3-25**] showed an ejection fraction which had increased back to
greater than 50%.  At that point there were still some
residual wall motion abnormalities in the left anterior
descending artery.  The patient was followed by a cardiology
consult service for the remainder of this hospital stay.
They questioned, and it was felt appropriate that the patient
undergo cardiac catheterization for evaluation of anterior
descending artery wall motion abnormalities.  The patient
deferred cardiac catheterization until after his rehab stay.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96121**] at [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation and planning of his
elective catheterization.

Hypertension:  The patient remained with significant
hypertension running systolic pressures in the 150's to 180's
and diastolic pressures in the 70's to 90's throughout the
remainder of the hospital course.  Antihypertensives were
titrated up such that on the day of discharge his
antihypertensive regimen including Labetalol 600 mg po bid,
Isordil 60 mg po tid, Captopril 100 mg po tid, Losartan 100
mg q d, Lasix IV 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] and a Clonidine patch.

3.  Neurology:  The patient was stable with normal mental
status at the time of admission, however, on [**3-15**] mental
status declined and at that point CT of his head was negative
for acute CNS bleed.  One day prior to this the patient had
been in the vascular Intensive Care Unit where he was noted
to have three generalized tonic clonic seizures that were
witnessed by staff on the floor.  MRI and CT showed bilateral
watershed infarct.  At this point the patient was started on
Dilantin and his mental status declined.  He was in a coma
for approximately two weeks but then his mental status
improved.  As of [**3-29**] his mental status was at his baseline
and he remained that way throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient had known effusions at the time
of admission and had an oxygen requirement.  A chest CT done
on [**3-14**] showed a large right lower lobe pulmonary embolism
and the patient was started on Heparin, however, on [**3-17**] he
had hematocrit drops on Heparin so Heparin was discontinued
and inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**3-18**].  The
patient had bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.  Left
sided effusion was tapped on [**3-1**] for one liter of
transudative fluid with symptomatic improvement.  The patient
still had bilateral pleural effusion at the time of discharge
with an oxygen requirement of approximately three liters by
nasal cannula and the plan was to attempt to minimize the
size of the effusion with diuresis.  His oxygen requirement
was stable at the time of discharge.

5.  Hematology:  The patient required multiple transfusions
during the stay.  However, from [**3-29**] to [**4-7**] the patient's
hematocrit was stable in the high 20's requiring only one
unit of packed red cells.  The patient was restarted on
Coumadin for anticoagulation on [**4-2**] and should have his INR
followed at rehab.

6.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had an episode of
pneumonia early in this hospital stay which resolved.
However, the patient did relatively well from an infectious
disease standpoint during this admission.  On [**3-29**] he had a
blood culture positive for coag negative staph, however, this
was taken off the PICC line and blood cultures drawn at that
time were otherwise negative.  The line was pulled.
Surveillance cultures remained negative and the decision was
made not to treat him.  This bacteria was found to be not
coag negative staph but Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.

7.  Renal:  Patient's creatinine was stable throughout this
admission.  He has a history of type 3 membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis with heavy proteinuria.  He was found to
have approximately 21 gm of protein in his urine per day.
The renal consult service followed him and started him on an
angiotensin receptor block and Losartan 100 mg po q d for
treatment of his proteinuria.  At the time of discharge he
was stable with regards to his proteinuria.  He should
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 951**] of renal team.  Ultimately the
plan is to start him on steroids for his proteinuria.

8.  Diet:  Patient is currently on tube feeds as well as oral
feeds.  His oral feeds should be increased as tolerated.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  SMA artery aneurysm status post embolization.
2.  Pulmonary embolism status post IVC filter placement and
Coumadin anticoagulation.
3.  Mild focal wall motion abnormalities in the left anterior
descending artery distribution.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Type III membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol 600 mg po bid, Captopril
100 mg po tid, Losartan 100 mg po q d, Isordil 60 mg po tid,
Clonidine patch .1 mg q 24 hours, Lipitor 10 mg q d, Lasix IV
200 mg [**Hospital1 **].  This will be changed to po calcium carbonate 500
mg [**Hospital1 **], subcu Heparin 5,000 units subcu [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol
Atrovent nebs q 4 hours prn.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good with oxygen requirement of
approximately three liters.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 38**] Rehab facility.

FOLLOW-UP:  With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96121**] of the cardiology service, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of nephrology service and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**] of the
GI service.  The patient will be given phone numbers for
appointments.

   LVH), who was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 1896**] service earlier this
   evening for shortness of breath and leg swelling.  On presentation, he
   complained of worsening DOE over the past few weeks, with associated
   PND and orthopnea.  He also was experiencing bilateral leg and scrotal
   swelling.  He triggered for hypotension in the ED and was given 1 L NS,
   with improvement of his BP.  ECG in the ED was noted to [**Location (un) 988**]
   voltage, poor R wave progression, TWI in V5-V6; CXR showed BL pleural
   effusions.  Labs in the ED showed an elevated creatinine to 2.2 from a
   baseline of 1.9, an elevated BNP, and a troponin of 0.24 with negative
   CK.  In the ED, he was given aspirin and treated with azithromycin and
   nebs for CPOD exacerbation.  On admission to F3, it was thought that
   the patient's symptoms represented an exacerbation of his underlying
   heart failure.  He was given lasix (20 mg IV x 1) and carvedilol (3.215
   mg x 1).  Within 1 hour of receiving these medications, his SBP dropped
   to 70/50 (from the 110's systolic).  He was noted to have a pulsus of 5
   and low voltage on ECG.  Pt was given total 2.5L NS bolus without
   effect, & started on dopa 5mcg/kg. The cardiology fellow was called out
   of concern for potential tamponade.  The patient was tranferred to the
   CCU for further management->started on pressors for hypotension.

Chief Complaint:
Increased abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with h/o PUD which was c/b gastric outlet obstruction
s/p vagotomy, antrectomy and bilroth II repair [**4-22**] c/b jejunal
stump leak and recurrent liver abscesses s/p drainage and
fistula creation, polymicrobial BSI s/p treatment course of
daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole (finished course of IV abx on
[**2129-11-17**]) presenting with worsening abdominal pain. Patient has
had an extensive medical course since surgery in [**4-22**] including
multiple hospitalizations and rehab stays and was on IV abx
until [**2129-11-17**]. She was living in an ECF ([**Month/Day/Year 5682**]) until around
when abx were discontinued and went home to live with her
husband. She was doing okay at home, with increasing PO intake
and a stable level of pain and nausea however over the last few
days, her pain has worsened. Per family, on Tuesday last week
patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital after a fall. Patient
doesn't remember the fall, but she had just taken several pain
medications (incl dilaudid, which she takes every 4 hours 4 mg
without fail) and per her daughter and husband she often gets
confused after taking her medications. She had a workup at
[**Hospital **] hospital which showed no fractures or other process, and
was discharged within a few hours to [**Hospital 5682**] ECF again.
.
Over the last few days at [**Hospital 5682**], paitent has complained of
worsening pain and stable nausea. Denies any vomiting,
constipation, cough, fevers, chills, or other symptoms. She
presented today for worsening pain despite her pain medications.
Pain is stabbing in nature associated with nausea. Also thinks
that her fistual output may be increasing.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.8 100 111/60 24 94% ra. ED exam
with diffuse ttp mainly over the RUQ/RLQ. Ostomy site with green
cloudy fluid. Labs notable for WBC 26.1, Hct 27.7 (at baseline),
ALT 131, AST 51, Na 132, HCO3 19, alk phos 1452. CT abd/pelvis
with Left lower lobe opacification compatible with pneumonia,
decreased mid abdominal collection. She received dilaudid 1 mg
IV x 2, zofran as well as IV ativan. Surgery consulted in ED,
recommended CT abd with contrast, CT abd was done which showed
abscesses largely unchanged but LLL PNA. Surgery recommended no
intervention now, admit to medicine for IV abx for PNA with
surgery following. Pt was given dose of vanco/zosyn for HCAP.
.
Currently, patient complains of [**4-21**] pain, much imprved from
when she came in, howver she is not oriented to place or year
having just received IV ativan and dilaudid. Per daughter who
gave most history, patient veyr often gets like this after
receiving pain or anxiety medications.

.
Per Opt ID note:
Subsequent course after initial surgery was complicated by
polymicrobial BSI (Enterobacter cloacae, VRE, MRSA, Clostridium)
and hepatic abscess requiring drainage on [**6-1**] (Enterobacter,
Enterococcus) s/p drain removal and prolonged course of
antibiotic therapy (daptomycin, ertapenem) ending [**7-6**].
.
She was re-admitted on [**7-15**] with a recurrent fluid collection.
Treatment with daptomycin and meropenem was re-initiated.  She
underwent CT guided drainage of that major collection and
cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans and [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], VRE.  Micafungin
was added to her antibiotic regimen.
.
In the setting of a persistent leukocytosis, she was found to
have a new liver abscess on [**7-30**] and underwent CT guided
drainage with fluid growing VRE, MRSA and yeast. On [**7-28**], her
antibiotics were simplifed to tigecycline, micafungin.  however
due to abdominal cramping which may have been in part related to
tigecycline, her regimen was changed to daptomycin, ertapenem,
and fluconazole on [**2129-8-11**].
.
On [**8-17**] she was readmitted to the hospital for elevation of LFTs
and increasing abdominal pain. CT of the abdomen on [**8-17**] showed
an increased fluid collection in the caudate lobe of the liver
measuring 2.1x2.3cm. Patient had CT guided drainage of the fluid
collection on [**8-19**] and culture results grew Klebsiella pneumoniae
that was pansensitive. Patient was maintained on Daptomycin and
Fluconazole however Ertapenem was changed to Meropenem on [**8-18**].
Decision was made to maintain the patient on Meropenem on
discharge instead of ertapenem for coverage of Enterbacter which
grew previously as she seemed to have improvement in her
abdominal pain, transaminitis, and remained afebrile with
Meropenem. Dosing was changed from q6h to q8h to help ease
administration of the medicine.
.
Antibiotic course:
[**Date range (1) 90350**] Daptomycin, Ertapenem
[**Date range (1) 3047**] Daptomycin
[**Date range (1) 90351**] Linezolid
[**Date range (1) 90352**] Meropenem
[**Date range (1) 29023**] Tigecycline (switched due to abd cramping)
[**Date range (1) 90353**] Micafungin
[**8-11**] abx changed to Daptomycin, Ertapenem, and Fluconazole on
discharge
[**8-18**] Daptomycin and Fluconazole continued from previous discharge
and Ertapenem changed to Meropenem
.
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**11-1**] which showed some minimal
improvement in previously seen fluid collections near the liver
though a new 2cm fluid collection was found in between the loops
of the jejunum (not amenable to percutaneous drainage).  On
[**11-17**], she was taken off Daptomycin, Meropenem.  An was started
on Bactrim DS 1 tab po BID and continue Fluconazole 400mg po
daily.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2129-12-11**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2129-12-5**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia. In
addition,
stable areas of right nodular opacification since [**2129-11-1**].
2. Interval decrease in mid abdominal collections in the region
of prior
surgery at the duodenal stump with no new fluid collections
identified;
however, a few small bubbles of gas remain with the shrunken
residual
collection.
3. Stable appearance of enterocutaneous fistula within the right
mid
abdominal wall.
4. Stable appearance of intrahepatic biliary dilation.
Correlation with
laboratory data and other clinical factors is recommended;
sequelae of a
stricture or even potentially a stone is possible despite the
lack of change. A small calcified gallstone on the prior study
is now absent and may have passed in the interim.
5. Stable appearance of markedly narrowed main portal vein and
attenuation of the left portal vein which is probably occluded
with collateral flow.
Persistent areas of differential enhancement of the liver may
accordingly be related to different flow patterns although it is
difficult to exclude
cholangitis.

[**2129-12-5**] LIVER & GALLBLADDER US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Turbulent flow in the proximal portion of the main portal
vein consistent with severe narrowing as seen on the preceding
CT.
2. The left portal vein could not be visualized, which could be
related to
thrombosis, as seen on the CT.
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation consistent with
postinflammatory stricture as noted previously. Gall bladder
wall thickening appears to relate to this contiguous
scarring/inflammatory change.

[**2129-12-10**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Improved, but still present left lower lobe
infiltrate.

[**2129-12-15**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post Billroth 2 with partial small bowel obstruction
of the efferent limb of the gastrojejunostomy, with marked
upstream dilatation of the jejunal limb continguous with the
duodenal stump, and moderate gastric distention.
2. Increase in extraluminal gas in right upper quadrant
including along the border of the left lobe of the liver, near
the oversewn duodenal stump and proximal jejunum, and at the
base of the enterocutaneous fistula. Compared to [**2129-12-5**], there
is a new 2.9 x 1.3 cm rim enhancing aortocaval fluid collection
near liver hilum.
3. Stable intrahepatic biliary dilatation and left chronic
portal vein
occlusion with cavernous transformation.
5. Persistent bibsilar pneumonia, improved on the left but
worsened on the
right.

[**2129-12-16**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm with an atrial premature beat. Baseline artifact.
Since the
previous tracing ventricular premature beat is not seen. Atrial
premature beat is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo F with h/o PUD which was c/b gastric outlet obstruction
s/p vagotomy, antrectomy and Billroth II repair [**4-22**] c/b jejunal
stump leak and recurrent liver abscesses s/p drainage and
fistula creation, polymicrobial BSI s/p treatment course of
daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole (finished course of IV abx on
[**2129-11-17**]) presenting with acute onset sharp abdominal pain, LLL
infiltrate on CXR and CT and unchanged abdominal collections
.
# Transaminitis: This is likely related to hepatic abscesses
which appear stable on CT scan vs hepatic vein thrombosis,
although is on Coumadin.  US and CT abdomen largely unchanged
from prior.  She was placed on linezolid and meropenem.  She
underwent ERCP on 10/27th and was hold off Coumadin prior to her
going over for ERCP.  After she returned, heparin gtt was
started with bridge to warfarin.  INR goal is [**3-17**]. She became
supratherapeutic and her Coumadin was held until her INR
normalized. LFTs improved prior discharge. INR was 1.7. The
patient was send home with [**Month/Day (3) 269**] to continue INR monitoring.
.
# LLL pneumonia/leukocytosis: Most likely related to PNA despite
lack of symptoms from PNA or cough. Patient does have
leukocytosis however to 26, with elevated alk phos and
transaminitis.  Imaging does not support intra-abdominal
process, but given extensive history, still a concern. The
patient has UTI with  ENTEROCOCCUS SP., blood cultures x 2 and
stool were negative. Knowing her history with multiple drug
resistant organisms in blood stream infections, including VRE,
Enterobacter resistant to pip/tazo (from [**2129-5-31**]), she was
changed to IV linezolid/meropenem. ID was consulted and their
recommendations were followed. The patient underwent empirical
treatment with IV Linezolid, Meropenem and Fluconazole, after
completion of the course, she was restarted on her home
antibiotic coverage with Bactrim DS and PO Fluconazole. Repeat
urine cultures were negative. She will continue to follow up
with ID as outpatient. On discharge, patient still has mild
leukocytosis, was afebrile with stable vital signs.
.
#SBO: Abdominal pain: worse in the last few days, abdominal pain
can be associated with PNA. CT abd doesn't appear to be changed
from prior, nausea is stable, no diarrhea or vomiting. Repeat CT
scan on [**2129-12-15**] demonstrated partial bowel obstruction. The
patient was made NPO with NGT, IVF and nutritional service was
called for TPN recommendations. PICC line was placed and TPN was
started on [**2129-12-17**]. On [**12-18**], NGT was removed, and diet was
advanced on [**12-19**], which were well tolerated. Diet was advanced
to regular on [**12-21**], and TPN was discontinued. Patient tolerated
regular diet well with good appetite and adequate oral intake.
.
#Anemia of chronic disease: The patient has a history of anemia
with Hct ~ 25. On [**2129-12-15**] Hct was 22.1 and patient received one
unit of RBC. After transfusion, Hct improved to baseline and was
24.0 prior discharge. Patient's PCP will continue to monitor her
Hct as outpatient.
.
#Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and
takes Soma, Dilaudid and Hyoscyamine. Fentanyl patch was added
to achieve better pain control per Chronic Pain Service. The
patient was discharged home with instruction to taper down her
Fentanyl patch within 3 weeks. [**Date Range 269**] instructed to monitor
patient's pain and will contact [**Name (NI) **] Surgery Service at [**Hospital1 18**]
with any questions or concerns.
.
At the time of discharge on [**2129-12-22**], the patient was doing
well, afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without
assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient was
discharged home with services and home PT. The patient received
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Coumadin (Warfarin):
What is this medicine used for?
This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not
form.
How does it work?
Warfarin changes the body's clotting system. It thins the blood
to prevent clots from forming.
What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing;
chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color;
fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe
dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you
hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel
fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically,
severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black,
tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds,
coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding,
severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.
Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for
whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems,
vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems
could affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.
Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet:
Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin.
For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat
while taking this medication.
Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid
foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of
vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However,
recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K
from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your
dietary vitamin K intake.

These foods contain vitamin K:
Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli,
Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower,
Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens,
Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver.
Other: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins,
Soybeans and Cashews.
Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage
but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious
problems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you
drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual
pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on
special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually
would on any regular day of the week.
Monitoring:
The doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by
testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is
clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for
bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for
forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood
test that is right for you ([**3-17**]). The blood test used for
monitoring is called an INR.
Use of Other medications:
When Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can
change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also
change the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to
talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you
are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics,
vitamins, or herbal products.
The [**Month/Day (3) 269**] will check you blood for Coumadin level. They will send
results to your PCP (Dr. [**Name (NI) 70277**]) and he will continue to
adjust your Coumadin intake.
.
Please continue to taper down your Fentanyl patch as prescribed.

History of Present Illness:
42 year old male with history of asthma, hypertension,
macrocytic anemia, DVT/PE in [**2108**] and erosive gastritis who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] with alcoholic pancreatitis and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute respiratory failure and shock.

Briefly, the patient increased alcohol consumption recently to
[**12-4**]+ pints daily in the setting of becoming unemployed ([**Month (only) 956**]
[**2112**]). Reportedly he had consumed no alcohol for ~ four days
prior to admission to OSH [**2113-12-13**] for abdominal pain. The
abdominal pain occurred ~9:30am on [**2113-12-13**] after he had a
light breakfast (half a bagel). He described the pain as
epigastric and tight band-like, with associated nausea, no
vomiting. +chills, no fevers or sweats.

He received 8 liters of volume resuscitation on the medicine
floor but became hypotensive to SBP60s on [**2113-12-14**] and was
transferred to the ICU where he was resuscitatied with 10-12
more liters but required norepinephrine to maintain his blood
pressures. His creatinine rose to 2.9 (from 1.0), his calcium
dropped to 4s, his magnesium also dropped to 1.2. CT
abdomen/pelvis (without contrast) showed severe pancreatitis but
no evidence of other complications. Because of his history of
prior DVT/PE and his hemodynamic instability, LENIs were
performed showing a DVT in his right popliteal fossa and the
patient was started on heparin gtt (at 1500 units). As his
abdomen became more distended, the patient developed respiratory
distress and was intubated ~ midnight [**2113-12-15**], sedated with
fentanyl (150mcg) and propofol (70mcg) and his norepi was
increased (0.9mcg). He was started on bicarb gtt for metabolic
acidosis and renal failure. Overnight [**2113-12-15**] from midnight to
7am, the patient was oliguric (130cc) and CXR showed low lung
volumes, atelectasis. His labs were notable for Na 121, K 5.9,
Cr 5.0, calcium 3.2, magnesium 1.8, CK 8565 and albumin 1.6. He
was treated for his hyperkalemia with IV bicarb gtt (100cc/hr),
10 grams IV calcium gluconate, insulin gtt (12 units, for blood
sugars 300s). Left IJ and arterial line placed prior to
transfer. The patient was started on Vasopressin en route (0.4)
and Vent settings were AC18, PS 22, PEEP 10, FiO2 60%.

On arrival to the ICU, inital vitals were, T: 97.2 BP: 68/39 P:
113 R: 12 O2: 100% on AC (PMV). The patient's norepi and
vasopressin were increased and phenylephrine was started, in
addition to fluid boluses. Bladder pressure was 25.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 yo M w/ PMH of asthma, HTN, macrocytic anemia, PE/DVT,
erosive gastritis, alcoholism, and prior bouts of
alcohol-induced pancreatitis requiring ICU stay in [**2108**],
transferred from OSH for shock, likely secondary to severe
pancreatitis.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Shock: Distributive and hypovolemic shock in the setting of
severe pancreatitis, resulting in respiratory failure, renal
failure, and pressor-dependence. Had questioned possible
cardiogenic component, given possibility of PE with known DVT,
however echo did not show signs of right heart strain and EF
normal.  On admission, started on triple pressors with
norepinephrine, vasopressin, and neosynephrine, but he was
quickly weaned off the neosynephrine.  He was aggressively
volume resuscitated, getting almost 20L of fluid within the
first day of arrival. Lactates normalized.  Able to
intermittently wean down pressors as he appeared to stabilize
after 3-4 days. His pressures improved with fluid removal w/
CVVH. Pt remained on low-dose norepi w/ CVVH until decision was
made to move towards comfort measures due after discussion with
family.

# Acute respiratory failure: Due to combination of shock with
aggressive volume resuscitation, ARDS, and extra-thoracic
pressure from abdominal distension.  PE thought to be unlikely
given normal echo, but could not obtain CTA given renal failure.
 Questioned possible pneumonia on admission-- sputum at OSH grew
moraxella and haemophilus at OSH and had positive gram stains
here at [**Hospital1 **], however never cultured any organisms from sputum
since his arrival at [**Hospital1 **].  Pt completed empiric 8 day treatment
for HAP/HCAP with Vancomycin/Zosyn/levofloxacin (finished [**12-20**]).  Started on ARDSnet protocol, paralyzed initially for more
effective ventilation.  Put on APRV for further recruitment and
increased oxygenation.  Weaned off paralytics.  Had numerous
episodes of spontaneous desaturations with movements from mucous
plugging, bronched on [**12-21**] with removal of thick mucous plugs.
Then able to start weaning down APRV settings, down to CMV. Pt
had a repeat bronchoscopy to try to remove excess mucus on [**12-29**]. Given his continued illness, Pt had a tracheostomy placed on
[**1-1**] by interventional pulmonology.

# Acute renal failure: Developed at the OSH, Cr 4.5 on transfer.
 Etiology likely ATN in the setting of shock and severe
hypovolemia.  Renal consulted, felt that CVVH would be
preferable to HD, given his severe acidosis on admission and his
hemodynamic instability.  Dialysis catheter placed [**12-16**] and
intiated CRRT that day.  Unfortunately experienced numerous
complications with his CRRT, including malfunctioning catheter
(requiring replacement [**12-20**]) and multiple episodes of clotting
in the filters.

# Fever, leukocytosis:  Course complicated by repeated fevers
and leukocytosis.  Most likely due to continuing pancreatitic
inflammation, perhaps formation of abscess/necrosis. Pt had a
very thorough workup for possible infectious etiology of his
fevers including multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, stool
cultures and C diff antigens, and sputum cultures. Pt was
treated for HAP/HCAP with Vancomycin/Zosyn/levofloxacin for 8
days. His chest x-ray continued to improve. He never grew any
signficant organisms from his urine culture, and he had several
c diff stool toxin tests which were all negative. Infectious
disease was consulted, which showed

# Pancreatitis: Likely [**1-4**] alcoholism.  OSH CT abdomen showed no
pseudocysts or necrotizing tissue but was limited by having no
IV contrast, impressive stranding seen however which may
organize in the next several days.   RUQ US did not show CBD
dilatation or stone.  Not continued on heparin despite DVT to
avoid causing pancreatic hemorrhage.  Triglycerides and lipase
trended down.  Repeat CT abdomen obtained on [**12-21**] due to rising
fevers and WBC count, showed increasing pancreatic inflammation
but no evidence of pseudocyst or drainable collection.

# Metabolic acidosis:  pH 7.03 initially on presentation, likely
from elevated lactate, sepsis, renal failure.  pH improved with
initiation of dialysis and increased ventilation of vent.

# Anemia: Likely multifactorial ?????? normocytic with low
reticulocyte index suggests ongoing alcohol abuse, chronic
illness. Also hemedilution with volume resuscitation. Low grade
GI bleed likely given guaiac positive from NG and flexiseal.
Heme looked at smear, no evidence of hemolysis.

# Thrombocytopenia: Likely splenic sequestration from alcoholic
liver disease and hemodilution.  Initially had concern for HIT,
however timing is not quite right.  HIT antibody sent anyway,
came back negative.  Heme evaluated, thought vanc/zosyn may
cause thrombocytopenia, no DIC, few spherocytes but no schistos
on smear. Lots of bands w/ toxic granulation consistent w/
sepsis.

# Increased bladder pressure:  Stable, in mid 20s, 29 right now.
KUB suggests ascites; the patient likely third spacing fluid
into his abdomen and also likely has liver cirrhosis,
malnutrition (low albumin).  Concerning for developing abdominal
compartment syndrome. Bladder pressure constant at 24. UOP 5
over the last day.

# Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Given
aggressive volume resuscitation, IVF boluses with normal saline
as respiratory status tolerates. Trend electrolytes q4 hours

# Alcohol abuse: Per the patient, had not had alcohol X 4 days
prior to admission. Does have history of DTs and difficult to
manage last admission for pancreatitis at [**Hospital1 18**] (in [**2108**])

# Transaminitis:  Stable, trending down

# Right lower extremity DVT: Seen on LENIs at OSH.  IVC filter
placed, back on heparin SC.

#Afib w/ RVR: started night of [**12-18**], seemed to be in response to
respiratory distress.  Now back in normal sinus.

# Asthma: Stable; significant issues with wheezing last
admission in [**2108**]

# Depression: Stable, likely self-medicating with alcohol

# Hypertension: Currently hypotensive on pressors

# Patient passed away [**2114-1-4**] at 0616 with family at bedside
following a discussion regarding goals of care.

   point they reprogrammed the device. Pt was sent to CCU for closer
   monitioring- he had 4 more episodes of NSVT and appropriately self ATP
   out of rhythym, no need for shock. Pt was given Amio bolus 150 x 1 and
   restarted on heparin gtt for hx Afib.
   Of note w each episode of [**Name (NI) 7023**] pt has been asymptomatic and un aware
   of  dysrhythmias overnite here.
   Ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT)
   Assessment:
   Pt admitted s/p ICD/pacer placement with failure to ATP in setting of
   recurrent NSVT- transferred after reprogramming for closer observation.
   Action:
   Pt developing 4 episodes of VT from 8p-12a- ATP each time. EP fellow
   consulted again- pt ordered for and received 150 mg amiodorone bolus
   and has subsequently not had any further VT. Heparin gtt was restarted
   no bolus 1750u at 12:30 am and is awaiting repeat PTT this AM w
   lytes/CBC.
   Response:
   Pt has remained free of VT since bolus of amiodorone, Pt had 4 episodes
   of VT with appropriate ATP out of each episode and remaining
   asymptomatic w each episode.
   Plan:
   Continue to closely assess- check AM labs/PTT- keep heparin at
   therapeutic doses. Check w team re: ? coumadin today or to hold in
   setting of possibly more intervention. Continue to keep pt, family
   aware of plan of care and progress and encourage pt to [**Name8 (MD) **] RN for any
   issue/problem/symptom. Decrease anxiety/teaching/support.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
   Pt s/p 2 procedures in the past couple of days requiring left arm
   immobilization and bedrest developing
   Back and neck discomfort.
   Action:
   Much change of position, back rubs, readjusting sling on left side as
   well as 2 doses Tylenol po.
   Response:
   Pt more comfortable s/p interventions.
   Plan:
   Continue to encourage pt to inform staff re: pain/need for change in
   position, rest from sling. Continue Tylenol PRN. HOB 30 degrees and
   keep left arm immobilized to decrease swelling/pain in that area.

Review of Systems-

[**Name (NI) **]  Received pt. somewhat cooperative, pleasant yet lethargic.  Answering questions somewhat appropriately but with obvious missing information demonstrating some confusion.  Info received w/ [**Name (NI) 648**] interpreter.  MS waxing and [**Doctor Last Name **] throughout the morning.  ETT for airway protection and resp. distress (elective)  and now sedated on fentanyl and versed infusions.  Bolus sedation method attempted but did not hold patient more than 10-15min, despite increasing doses.  Infusion started during central line placement to maintain pt. safety and comfort on ventilator.  Pt. observed to be distressed, dysynchronous and agitated w/o cont. infusion.  Pt. able to follow commands w/ current levels of sedation.

Resp-  Received on NC 4L w/ intermittent distress and increased WOB.  Exp wheezing noted and pt. placed on q1-3 hour nebs.  ETT without incident.  Bronchoscopy done immediately after intubation- results as mentioned above.  Sigificant secretions aspirated.  No tracheal bronchial malasia appreciated so stenting is only hold for now.  Sats maintained.  Increased WOB and distress while ventilated noted and pt. sedation increased.  Vent changes made according to last ABG showing poor ventilation w/ increasing PCO2.  PEEP increased, fio2 decreased to aide in autopeeping.  Would anticipate that pt. will remain intubated for CT adn further w/[**Location 10756**] [**First Name (Titles) 16**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
