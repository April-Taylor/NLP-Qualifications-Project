Studies:
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2108-10-23**] 4:58 PM
Reason: line placement
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-23**], 4:08 p.m.

Right PIC line has been removed, new right internal jugular line
ends in the upper SVC and a new left PIC line ends just above
the superior cavoatrial junction. Lateral aspect of the left
lower chest is excluded from the study, other pleural surfaces
are unremarkable. Heart remains top normal size and there is
mild engorgement of pulmonary vasculature but no edema or
interval mediastinal widening or indication of pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ANKLE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT  [**2108-10-23**] 4:59 PM

The ankle mortise is congruent without evidence of fracture.

Osteotomies involving the fourth and fifth metatarsals as well
as resection of the distal fourth ray are unchanged from the
previous exam. No cortical destruction is seen. There is soft
tissue swelling around the ankle and foot, likely representing
edema/cellulitis.

IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling likely indicating cellulitis.
No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.

Approved: TUE [**2108-10-23**] 7:01 PM

ECHO [**2108-10-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. A mass or vegetation on the
mitral valve cannot be excluded. There is probably moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (in part due to the significant MAC).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-12-28**],
the degree of pulmopnary hypertension detected has increased. If
clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended to exclude
endocarditis and to determine the degree of valvular mitral
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F h/o recurrent RLE cellulitis, IDDM, CAD s/p CABG
presents with RLE cellulitis and sepsis. On presentation, SBP
was 86, with lactate 3.6, WBC 19. SBP improved to 120s w/ 2L IVF
and her lactate dropped to 1.4. After 4-5th L IVF, SBP dropped
to the 80s. Was started on pressors and abx regimen of
daptomycin and vancomycin; transferred to MICU. In MICU pressors
weaned off, minimal maint IVF started. Was continued on
daptomycin and vancomycin, which were later changed to
piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin.  The L PICC line, which
the patient had had for 1 month, was pulled and tip sent for
culture. New PICC line placed, pt transferred out to floor.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for blood sugar management. Podiatry was
consulted for surgery once cellulitis improved. ID was consulted
regarding antibiotic regimen.
.
# RLE cellulitis: Pt's erythema and tenderness resolving.
Underwent right 4th metatarsal head resection by podiatry on
[**2108-10-30**]. Bone samples were sent for microbiology and pathology
examination. Pt had bandage takedown by podiatry on POD #2,
cleared for discharge. Sent home on Vancomycin and Zosyn, to be
continued for 2 full weeks post-op, with possible extension to
4-week course pending micro/path results from biopsy specimen
sent from surgery.
.
# Recent sepsis: Pt stabilized after IVF, continued to have
stable BP while on medicine wards.
.
# CAD: Pt was without symptoms of CAD during her hospital stay.
She was continued on her home regimen of ASA, statin, BB, and
ACE-I.
.
# IDDM: Pt's FSBS were uncontrolled, likely given her infection
and then surgical course, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted regarding
adjustments to her home diabetes regimen. After adjustments were
made during the hospitalization, [**Last Name (un) **] recommended changing her
back to her home insulin regimen in preparation for discharge.
She had appropriate control of her FSBS on this home regimen
after her surgery and pre-discharge.

Primary Diagnoses:
1. RLE cellulitis
2. sepsis
3. diabetes
4. PVD
Secondary Diagnoses:
- CAD s/p CABG
- h/o lung cancer
- h/o CVAs


Discharge Condition:
afebrile, vital signs stable, tolerating POs, with improving
pain and resolving infection in the right leg, bandaged and in
post-op shoe by podiatry.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2108-10-23**], for an infection of your right leg
(cellulitis).  You were admitted to the MICU for low blood
pressures that required vasopressors, and you were started on
Zosyn and Vancomycin as antibiotic treatment for your infection.
 In the MICU, you were weaned off the vasopressors and
maintained on IV fluids.  Multiple X-rays of your right leg and
feet showed no evidence of infection in the bone
(osteomyelitis).  An echocardiogram was done, which showed no
evidence of an infection in your heart (endocarditis).  Your
left PICC line was changed, and podiatry was consulted for
surgery of the right foot wound once your infection improved.
You were taken to the operating room for debridement of the
wound, and the head of the 4th metatarsal bone was removed and
sent for microbiology and pathology.  You continued to do well,
and were discharged on a 2-week course of Zosyn and Vancomycin
with close follow-up.
.
During your hospital stay, your blood sugars were also
poorly-controlled, so the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes team was consulted to
help manage your blood sugars.  By the time your were ready for
discharge, your blood sugars were under good control on your
home insulin regimen.
.
If you develop worsening foot pain, redness, swelling, or
warmth, or if you develop fevers or chills, you should call your
doctor immediately and return to the emergency room.
.


Followup Instructions:
You will need to have your Vancomycin trough, ESR, and CRP
checked by the VNA on [**2108-10-31**], with the results sent
to your PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also need to have your CBC, Chem 7, and
LFTs checked once weekly while you are on these antibiotics,
with the results also to be sent to your PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need to
follow-up with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Location (un) 5164**], on Wednesday, [**11-7**], at 10:15AM.
You will also need to follow-up with your Infectious Disease
doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], within the next two weeks.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] should

CERVICAL SPINE CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The bones are severely demineralized. There is a comminuted
fracture of the vertebral body of C2, which extends through the
base of the odontoid (odontoid fracture type III, which is
unstable). The odontoid fragment is displaced anteriorly by 4
mm. A small posterior fragment of C2 vertebral body is displaced
into the spinal canal (series 2, images 20-21) without any
significant narrowing of the spinal canal. The fracture extends
into the left vertebral foramen.

There are minimally displaced fractures of the right and left
lamina and the spinous process of C7. There is a nondisplaced
fracture of the left lamina of T3. No definite fractures are
identified at C5, although severe demineralization limits
evaluation.

Mild loss of vertebral body height, disc space narrowing,
degenerative endplate changes and facet arthrosis is present at
multiple levels. Disc/osteophyte complexes at C3/4, C4/5, and
C5/6 result in mild narrowing of the spinal canal.

The left mastoid is underpneumatized compared to the right and
partially opacified. There is a retention cyst in the right
maxillary sinus. The patient is intubated. The thyroid gland is
diffusely enlarged and heterogeneous with multiple nodules.

Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 698**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 4:00 p.m. on [**2146-12-27**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted C2 fracture involving the odontoid (type III
odontoid fracture), which is unstable. The fracture extends
through the left vertebral foramen. If there is a clinical
concern for vertebral dissection, MRA may be performed for
further evaluation.
2. Fracture of bilateral posterior elements of C7.
3. Fracture of left T3 lamina.
4. Partially opacified left mastoid air cells.
5. Diffusely enlarged and nodular thyroid. Further evaluation by
ultrasound is recommended, if not performed previously.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bronchoscopic-guided tracheostomy
tube placement.

PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration of
secretions.

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Tracheostomy tube placement and
therapeutic aspiration of secretions.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was prepped with lidocaine applied to the
endotracheal tube. A flexible bronchoscope was introduced
through the ET tube and into the airway. There were a
moderate amount of secretions throughout the airways which were
therapeutically aspirated. There were no endobronchial lesions
up
to the subsegmental levels. Bronchoscopic imaging was then
performed in order to guide a percutaneous tracheostomy tube
insertion.  After the trachesotomy, a minimal amount of bloody
secretions were removed with the bronchoscope.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

PROCEDURE:  Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Need for long-term nutrition.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, the patient was given a single dose of vancomycin 1
gram IV, and was placed on a 45-degree angle. The patient was
already sedated with propofol and mechanical ventilation. The
gastroscope was inserted through the oral cavity and passed
through the esophagus into the stomach. The mucosa was
entirely normal with no obvious lesions.

The skin over the left upper quadrant was palpated, and a
sharp indentation with 1 finger was seen, as well as
excellent transillumination. The skin was prepped with
chlorhexidine and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Local
anesthesia was employed with 1% lidocaine at the left upper
quadrant site. An Angiocatheter was inserted under direct
vision, and a snare was lassoed and pulled back through the
esophagus and into the oral cavity. A 20 French PEG tube was
loaded and pulled back through the oral cavity in the
esophagus and through the abdominal wall. The gastroscope was
reinserted to confirm excellent placement with a mushroom cap
against the abdominal wall cavity. Bolsters were placed at 3
cm to secure the PEG tube.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with DM, HTN, s/p pacer placement for
complete heart block transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on the date of
admission, s/p a fall 2 days prior to her arrival. In the
incident, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was vacuuming at home and fell backwards,
striking her head against toilet.  She denies loss of
consciousness. A CT head was without acute changes, and the pt
was noted to be dehydrated and had LLL PNA.  A CT C spine showed
C2 and C5 laminar fractures, and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for neurosurgical evaluation.  At time of transfer, pt
reportedly had no neuro deficits, was able to move all
extremities, and c/o neck pain at times. She was initially
admitted to the wards for ongoing treatment. Shortly after her
admission, she was noted to have increasing O2 requirements.
She was tachypneic to the 30s-40s, worse with being woken up.
Her O2 requirement - initially 94% 4L NC - increased to 93% on
6L NC, then up to 97-98% on 100% NRB.  At the time of eval, she
was 95% on 12L and she was transferred to the MICU for closer
monitoring with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
.
Her MICU course, by problem:
[**Age over 90 **]F with DM, HTN, s/p pacer, with hypoxemic and hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
#  Respiratory Failure - Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a persistent ventilator
requirement throughout her MICU stay, eventually requiring
placement of a tracheostomy tube and percuteaneous gastrostomy
tube. CT scans of the chest showed pleural effusions and she
completed two separate courses of antibiotics
(vancomycin/cefepime) for evolving pneumonias. She remained
intermittently dependent upon ventilator support and now
tolerates trach collar for longer periods of time, particularly
in the daytime hours. Bronchoscopy did not show cause for her
persistent requirement. She will need to continue antibiotics
for a total 14 day course (started [**2147-1-11**]).
.
#  Low grade fever and leukocytosis-  Felt to be related to her
bacteremia, likely stemming from pneumonia. She grew coag
negative staph from her blood cultures on [**2147-1-11**]. She was
treated with vancomycin and cefepime. A BAL grew only
oropharyngeal organisms. Urine cx on [**1-12**] +yeast
.
#  C-Spine fractures - Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18095**] a C2 fracture,
extending up to the odontoid, and a C7 fracture in her initial
fall. She was evaluated by neurosurgery and felt not to be a
candidate for halo placement given her age and comorbidities.
She was placed in a hard cervical collar, which will remain for
3 months from the date of injury. She will need to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, approximately 4 weeks from
discharge. A Head CT was negative for intracranial injury.
.
#  chronic kidney disease - Baseline Cr not known- stable.
.
#  DM2 - Pt is on oral hypoglycemics at home (metformin), which
were held during her hospitalization to allow for better control
of her glucose levels. She may be restarted on her meds as an
outpatient.
.
#  HTN - Her home regimen antihypertensives were held and IV
medications were used as needed for BP control.
.
#  Code - Ms. [**Known lastname **] is full code, this was confirmed with son
[**Name (NI) **].
.
#  Communication - son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 71019**]

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD,
hypertension, severe PVD s/p bilateral BKA, and LVH with LVOT
who is presenting with acute shortness of breath. She was in her
usual state of health until earlier this evening when she
noticed that she ""just didn't feel right."" When she went to lay
down, she noted the onset of shortness of breath.  She denied
chest pain or palpitations. She had her last HD session on
Friday. She denies eating salty food or missing medications
.
In the ED her initial vital signs were 220/110 120 RR 40 and
100% on BIPAP.  She continued on BIPAP with improvement in her
oxygenation.  An EKG was interpreted as unchanged from prior.
Nitro-paste was administered for blood pressure control.  A left
femoral central line was placed for IV access.  Both cardiology
and nephrology were consulted who recommended urgent dialysis
for volume control.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain,  palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD,
severe PVD, LVH with LVOT obstruction presenting with shortness
of breath and pulmonary edema.
.
# CAD:
Although patient has with multiple CAD risk factors, prior
non-invasive and invasive testing showed no significant
obstructive coronary disease.  A troponin of 0.04 in the context
of normal CK and EKG with no ST-T changes was likely demand
ischemia secondary to hypertensive heart disease. Admission EKG
did not show signs of active ischemia and the patient was
monitored on telemetry and continued on aspirin and statin.
.
# CHF:
The pt's hypoxia was attributed to CHF and not pneumonia as she
denied any cough, and was afebrile and lacking a consolidate on
chest xray. Pulmonary embolism was also unlikely as the patient
is on chronic anticoagulation.  Due to chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure and a physiologic HOCM that leads to
hypotension during dialysis sessions, it is most likely that the
patient developed pulmonary edema  in the setting of volume
status change while receiving dialysis.  Her oxygenation status
improved significantly following blood pressure and rate control
and a dialysis session. There are no PFT's to support the
diagnosis of COPD, but marked hyperinflation on CXR and notable
smoking history indicated strong possibility of COPD
contributing to patient's symptoms so patient was treated with
home dose of spiriva and albuterol as needed. The patient was
weaned on BiPap and began to breathe comfortably on room air
following dialysis.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:
The pt was anticoagulated with coumadin and rate controlled with
metoprolol and diltiazem for her history of atrial fibrillation.

.
# Hypertension:
The patient's hypertension was also controlled with diltiazem
and metoprolol and following a successful dialysis session her
lisinopril and irbesartan were restarted.
.
# Diabetes:
For her diabetes the patient was continued on her home dose of
NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Hyperkalemia:
The patient has end stage renal disease and receiving HD.  The
patient was orginally volume overloaded and on day two of
admission developed hyperkalemia to a K of 6.7.  She had no
peaked T waves or QT prolongation on EKG and received calcium
carbonate and D5/insulin as well as dialysis.  Her electrolytes
were monitored closely with subsequent K between 4.1 and 5.0.

# Heme:
On admission labs the patient was erythrocytotic. Prior
evaluations had not shown renal mass that could contribute to
over production of erythropoietin and on [**2163-5-30**] the epo
level was low normal which would suggest a MPD such as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Patient would benefit from heme follow up as an outpatient.

Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath, recurrent pericardial effusion
found on routine echo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window ([**2102-12-28**])


History of Present Illness:
72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], transferred from
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation and management of recurrent
pericardial effusion and tamponade seen on routine repeat echo.
.
Patient had past admission on [**5-5**]/09 for fatigue, edema,
and decreased exercise tolerance. Found to have pericardial
effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis with removal 300 cc clear
slightly blood-tinged pericardial fluid, with decrease in
pericardial pressure from 26 to 10 mmHg. Patient also underwent
pericardial drain placement. Pericardial fluid culture and
cytology returned negative. Fluid analysis revealed WBC# 6100
(81% PMN), RBC [**Numeric Identifier 83167**] TP 5.1 albumin 2.9 gluc 4 LDH 4230. The
effusion was attributed to RA, but methotrexate was discontinued
(and prednisone increased from 20 to 30 mg daily) in case the
former was contributing.
.
Routine follow-up TTE today at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to
moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with diastolic
right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade. Transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management, where triage V/S 98 125
138/83 18 94%RA. HR 101 without intervention. Labs notable for
INR 3.7, Hct 30.5. EKG showed low voltage in the limb leads. CXR
showed only bibasilar linear atelectasis. Vital signs prior to
transfer 95 132/87 20 97%RA.
.
On the floor, patient is feeling relatively well. Reports having
some shortness of breath, but is at his baseline due to his
COPD. Denies any chest pain, worsening SOB, orthopnea,
palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness.

Echocardiogram ([**2102-12-25**])
FINDINGS:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION:
Limited study,. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal. A small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial
effusion is present with diastolic right ventricular collapse
suggestive of tamponade.
Reffering physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 13109**].

Additional In-house Read:
Small amount of pericardial fluid and no evidence of RV
diastolic collapse.
.
ECHO [**2102-12-30**]
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
body habitus. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal although views are
technically suboptimal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-5-26**],
the pericardial effusion is now smaller.
.
AP Chest [**2102-12-31**]
Study is limited as the lung bases have been excluded from the
field of view. There is again seen some streaky densities at the
bases most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis which is
unchanged. The upper lung fields are clear without focal
consolidation or signs of overt pulmonary edema. Cardiac
silhouette is unchanged, within normal limits.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2102-12-25**] 6:28 PM
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette is normal in
size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary
vascularity is
normal. Linear opacities within both lung bases are compatible
with linear
atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
visualized. No acute skeletal abnormalities are seen.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar linear atelectasis. No acute
cardiopulmonary
abnormality otherwise visualized.
.
CXR [**2103-1-1**]
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases has
improved since
[**12-30**], probably atelectasis. On the left, it is conceivable
that
pneumonia was present and is rapidly clearing, but there is no
new or
worsening consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
effusion or
mediastinal widening. Heart size is normal

Brief Hospital Course:
72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], presents with
recurrent pericardial effusion concerning of tamponade and
complaints of some progressive shortness of breath.

#. Pericardial effusion - patient has had history of pericardial
effusion in the past, thought to be a complicaton of RA. Had a
pericardiocentesis with drain placement in 5/[**2101**]. Initially had
methotrexate discontinued for concerns of worsening pericardial
effusion, but was restarted back on it in [**Month (only) 205**] when patient did
not tolerate Humira well. Patient has been receiving regular
follow up with his cardiologist with a repeat echo every 6
weeks.  His echo read done at [**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate
mainly anterior pericardial effusion with evidence of diastolic
right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.  An
additional read done by cardiology service here showed small
amount of fluid with no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.  He
was hemodynamically stable during his admission and breathing
was not labored, although reported to be slightly worse over the
last few weeks.  Pulsus was checked twice a day and remained
consistently around 7-8mmHg.  Methotrexate was held given the
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.  Patient was evaluated by
thoracic surgery for pericardial window.  Procedure was
performed on [**2102-12-28**] with drainage of only 80cc of fluid and
was complicated by afib with RVR.
The drainage tube was subsequently removed and he is being
followed with serial imaging which at the time of discharge
showed a smaller pericardial effusion on echo and only
atelectasis on CXR. Fluid culture was positive for
propionobacterium acnes which was felt to be a contaminant.
Biopsy from pericardial window showed unremarkable cartilage and
skeletal muscle and fragments of pericardium with chronic
inflammation and fibrin deposition.
.
#. A fib - patient takes warfarin at home, was found to be
supratherapeutic at INR of 3.7 on admission. INR was reversed
for the pericardial window. He was bridged on heparin drip to
coumadin and the coumadin alone was continued once his INR was
therapeutic.
.
#. HTN - patient was continued on home dosage of metoprolol,
furosemide, and spironolactone during admission.  Valsartan was
substituted for his home dose of olmesartan during admission,
but patient was switched back to olmesartan on discharge.
.
# Anemia: he was found to have a microcytic anemia consistent
with anemia of chronic disease. An outpatient colonoscopy can be
considered as an outpatient.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - patient was continued on home regimen of
pravastatin
.
#. Rheumatoid Arthritis - patient's home regimen of methotrexate
was held for pericardial effusion.  Was restarted on discharge
after his pericardial window procedure.
.
#. COPD - currently at baseline, patient was in no respiratory
distress.  During admission he was maintained on home dose of
spiriva.  Advair was substituted for symbicort while admitted,
but patient was restarted on symbicort on discharge.
.
#. DM - patient was continued on his home regimen of insulin as
well as regular insulin sliding scale.
.
#. GERD - patient was continued on omeprazole
.
#. Glaucoma - patient was continued on prednisolone drop to left
eye and artificial tears

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
recurrent pericardial effusion seen on a routine echocardiogram.
 During this admission, we reviewed the echocardiogram that was
performed at [**Location (un) 620**] and found that while there is some fluid
present, it is not causing any tamponade of your heart.  A
pericardial window was performed by thoracic surgery to help
drain the fluid around your heart and prevent future
reaccumulation.  Please continue to regularly follow up with
your cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**], as you have been doing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: After an extensive workup in the ED, she had
activity that appeared to be a seizure, and was started on
dilantin.  She was extensively hydrated, and her hypernatremia
was corrected from 162 to 140 over the next two days.  She was
noted to be in acute renal failure, thought to be due to an
ATN-type picture.  She was also found to be hypothyroid and an
initial echo showed an EF of <10% with global LV akinesis.  She
required pressor support for her hypotension and remained
intubated for breathing support.  Her MICU course by systems is
as follows:

CV: Elevated CKs on admission but no evidence of MI from
troponins or EKG changes.  Echo on [**2188-4-14**] showed LV dysfunction
as noted above, noting EF<10% as well as 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Also
noted at that time to have a large LV thrombus as well as LAA
thrombus, for which she was started on IV heparin.  Over the
course of her MICU stay her hypotension resolved and gradually
she developed mild hypertension, for which she was started on
isordil and nifedipine.  Repeat echo performed [**2188-4-25**] shows
global LV dysfunction but improvement in LVEF to 20-25%, with
left thrombi still visible.  Her PTT has been maintained in the
55-75 range and she was started on coumadin today.  Cardiology
has been following closely.  Her hypothermia resolved with
passive warming on admission, although she has had several
episodes of mild hypothermia off and on over her hospital stay
which has resolved with blankets and monitoring.

Neuro: Seizure activity last noted on [**4-22**], EEG performed
[**2188-4-18**] which showed global slowing without focal abnormalities
indicative of a diffuse metabolic, toxic, or infectious process.
 Was switched to Keppra on [**4-22**].  Neurological exams have been
non-focal to date, with a gradual improvement in mental status
over the course of her MICU stay. At the time of discharge, she
is awake and talking but not completely oriented and very
lethargic, but this is vast improvement over initial
assessments.  She has had an extensive head and neck workup upon
admission which has been largely negative save for evidence of
old lacunar infarcts.  Neuro has been following closely.  As her
mental status improved, it became apparent that the patient
suffered from cortical blindness with associated neglect of her
deficit; MRI exam failed to demonstrate discrete lesions
affecting her visual pathways.

Renal:	Acute renal failure with low urine output on admission
and was started on CVVH [**4-13**] and switched to hemodialysis on
[**4-17**] for which she had a tunneled RIJ catheter placed. Urine
protein to creatinine ratios since [**4-14**] have been consistently
higher than 3.0, indicative of a probable nephrotic syndrome,
but U/A microscopy showed only scant muddy-brown casts. At the
time of discharge, she had increased urine output and was
started on an oral diuretic regimen. She did not require
hemodialysis for 4-5 days prior to discharge and her creatinine
remained stable.

Endocrine: long-standing NIDDM with unknown complications, and
has required NPH and sliding scale insulin during the MICU
admission.  Hypothyroidism initially treated with levothyroxine
and IV T3, which has improved her lab values, and the IV T3 was
stopped on [**4-24**], and she has remained on the levothyroxine.
Considerable thought has been given to the idea that this
clinical picture may be one of myxedemic coma, and endocrine has
been following as well, but is not convinced this is the case.
She was also noted to have low cortisol response on admission
and was started on IV steroids, has since been tapered down and
is currently on a prednisone taper which was completed by the
time of discharge.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 54741**] was markedly thrombocytopenic on admission with
platelets around 30K, but this remained somewhat stable and has
improved with platelet transfusions (3 total, most recently on
[**2188-4-23**]).  Her hematocrit on admission was low (21.7) and she
has received a total of 6 units RBCs since admission (most
recently 2 units on [**4-21**]).  The heme service was constuled and
felt that there was no evidence of ongoing hemolysis but that
her iron studies show some indication of a possible chronic
anemia unrelated to her iron levels, and a continually low
reticulocyte count. If there are any future concerns, she should
follow up with hematology.

Pulmonary: Pt was intubated on admission and remained intubated
until [**4-24**].  During that time she was initially clear on CXR but
developed bilateral layered effusions bilaterally (R>L) and a
focal  ground glass opacity in the LUL.  The effusion is thought
to be evidence of CHF, infection, or aspiration.  The patient
was started on a week course of Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and
Levofloxacin shortly after admission, and finished her course on
[**4-19**], with no evidence of infection since.   Serial CXRs have
shown a gradual increase in size of the pleural effusions with
atelectasis and collapse of the lower lungs. These effusions
were felt to be secondary to heart failure and improved with
diuresis.

F/E/N:	As noted the hypernatremia corrected over the first few
days and her other electrolytes have remained reasonably stable
with hemodialysis.  She has a NGT placed and is currently
receiving her enteral nutrition through this.  She has been
noted to have increasing edema, thought to be secondary to her
poor renal output, which have been increasing somewhat lately.
The patient was seen by Speech and swallow and deemed safe for
oral intake in a monitored setting.

GU: Treated for  a yeast infection

CODE:	PATIENT IS DNR/DNI

DISPO:	transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Unable to obtain as on ventilator
Obtained history from nursing home records. Called both
HCP/guardians but unable to reach. Patient unable to provide
history as has developmental disabilities with good receptive
language skills but non-verbal due to presence of tracheostomy
placed on [**2111-1-13**].
54F MR, tracheomalacia s/p tracheostomy in [**2107**], PVD, multiple
aspiration pneumonias, DM2 among other conditions who had low
oxygen saturations at her nursing facility. She was noted to
have thick yellow secretions from her trach tube on [**2112-8-9**].
She was started on zithromax. It was noted that today her pulse
ox was low in 70s-80s on supplemental oxygen with no improvement
with suction today. She was tremulous and bluish. She was
transferred to the ER for further care.
Of note, the patient has tracheomalacia. She was hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of severe PVD in Feburary [**2110**] at which
time she went into respiratory distress from pulmonary edema.
Adequate intubation was not possible due to tracheomalacia, and
she underwent open tracheostomy. She stabilized but remained
ventilator dependent for severe week but eventually weaned at
pulmonary rehab. Because of tracheomalacia and subsequent trauma
from tracheostomy (Portex #7), she will likely remain
teacheostomy dependent and not a candidate for decannulation.
Per the IP team, she is not a candidate for a PM valve.
At baseline, she receives continuous humidifcation via trach
mask and large volume nebulizer. The FiO2 settings is from 21-40
% to keep O2 sat > 90 %.
The patient also has a history of bipolar disorder with a long
history of mood swings including agitation, assault, and
depression.

CXR showed limited lung volumes with no acute intrathoracic
process detected although ? pneumonia.
She was given vancomycin, zosyn, and levaquin.
Access was difficult with 20G peripheral IV in shoulder and
failed attempt of right femoral line.
Patient was placed on a ventilator due to continued respiratory
distress and tachycardia. Vent settings were 350x20, PEEP 5,
FIO2 40 %. She was suctioned x 2.

Imaging:
[**2112-8-10**]
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy tube is appropriately
positioned.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
crowding.  The central pulmonary vessels are engorged, however,
no overt edema is seen.  There is no definite consolidation,
pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.

[**2112-8-15**]
Renal U/s
FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to patient body
habitus, edema and portable technique. The right kidney is 8.6
cm and the left kidney is 10.1 cm.  There is no obvious
hydronephrosis. We cannot evaluate for stones or masses. The
bladder is not seen.

[**2112-8-15**]
Chest CT
FINDINGS:  There are no pulmonary arterial filling defects to
suggest the
presence of pulmonary embolism.  There is no aortic dissection.
There are
small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions as well as
large areas of atelectasis bilaterally.  On the left, most of
the posterior basal segment is collapsed.  There are also
multiple areas of airspace consolidation consistent with
multifocal pneumonia.
  There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the
mediastinum.  The largest are a 19 x 12 mm right paratracheal
lymph node (3:19) and a 20 x 11 mm paraesophageal lymph node
further inferiorly (3:34).  Severe tracheomalacia is again
identified beginning just distal to the endotracheal tube and
continuing through the carina (3:10).  This is similar in extent
and severity to the prior examination from [**2112-4-13**].  No
focal osseous lesions are identified.  There is extensive
atherosclerotic calcification within the thoracic aorta and
coronary arteries.  A small pericardial effusion is present,
without evidence
of tamponade as well as a probable edematous lymph node in the
epicardial fat pad (4:112).

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia and segmental atelectasis, with small
bilateral
non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions.
3.  Severe tracheomalacia.
4.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive hypertrophy in
the setting of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
53F history of mental retardation, tracheomalacia s/p
tracheostomy with multiple aspiration pneumonias, DM2 among
other conditions who presented with tachypnea, increased oxygen
requirement, and thick secretions from tracheostomy concerning
for sepsis from a pulmonary source. Was found to have sputum
positive for pseudomonas and blood culture positive for E. Coli.
Both organisms were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

# Sepsis from a pulmonary and/or urinary source, initially
treated with broad coverage with vancomycin and cefepime.
Received fluid resuscitation. Initial lactate was 3.4, which
cleared with resuscitation. Pt. had episode of hypotension to
SBPs of 70s requiring placement of femoral CVC, and brief use of
NE for less than 24 hours. CVC was then pulled and a PICC line
was placed.

Blood Cx showed E. Coli, and suputum culture showed pseudomonas,
both of which were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. When this data
was obtained, antibiotic coverage was narrowed to just
ciprofloxacin. As patient was also on large doses of seroquel,
EKG was obtained, which showed normal QTc.

She is to continue a 15 day course of antibiotic coverage for
pseudomonas VAP/E. Coli bacteremia with ciprofloxacin. End date
for cipro is [**2112-8-25**].

# Respiratory failure
Patient may have respiratory failure secondary to pulmonic
process such as pneumonia or tracheobronchitis with some
component of mucous plugging per reports in ER. Pt. was able to
be weaned off the vent, saturating well with trach mask. The
evening before discharge she was placed on pressure support
ventilation to see if this would improve her tachycardia. She
was able to come off of vent on day of discharge. Would likely
benefit from CPAP at night and albuterol nebulizer.

# Anemia: Likely multifactorial ACD, acute blood loss, and
dilutional. Admitted at baseline Hgb ~ 10. Crit dropped after
placement of fem line with bleeding noted at fem site, concern
for retroperitoneal bleed at that time but responded
appropriately to 4 units with no evolving signs of bleeding.
Remained stable, then dropped two days later in context of 2L
fluid bolus, bumped appropriately to 2 units PRBC. Hematocrit
stable at discharge.

# Altered mental status: Patient waxed and waned. Initially
attributed to sepsis and respiratory distress, the patient was
eventually decreased on Seroquel from 250mg TID to 125mg TID.
She became alert and oriented at discharge.

# Tachycardia: Etiology unclear, developed tachycardia to 120's
after sepsis resolved. Responded to CPAP at night, IVF, and
resumption home metoprolol.

# Rash: Likely drug reaction to cefepime-erythematous blanching
over abd and torso, nonpruritic, no swelling, no pustules,
evolved two days after cefepime started and one day after vanc
DC'd. Rash resolved with narrowing to ciprofloxacin. The patient
had some relief with hydrocortisone cream.

# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia, admitted Na 130, rose
to 141 with IVF.

Chronic Issues:
# Peripheral Vascular Disease: Lower extremity pulses are
evidence by doppler on admission. Continued ASA 325 mg PO qD,
held fenofibrate, restarted at discharge.

# Bipolar disorder
She had no active signs or symptoms of psychiatric
decompensation. Continued seroquel 250 mg PO TID initially, then
decreased to 125mg TID in the setting of altered mental status.
Continued valproic acid syrup 500 mg PO qAM and 750 mg PO qPM.

# DM2: Blood sugars were stable, Lantus decreased from 48 to 35
units at bed time.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine

# Hypertension: After sepsis resolved, pressures stabilized.

# Glaucoma: Continued latanoprost drops qAM

# Osteoporosis: Continued calcium and vitamin D after sepsis
stabilized

Final Report
AP CHEST, 12:48 A.M., [**6-22**]
HISTORY: Chest tube pulled, evaluate for pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-21**]:
Following removal of endotracheal, nasogastric, midline drainage
and pleural tubes, there is more atelectasis at the lung bases,
cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly larger, there is very
pronounced gaseous distention of the stomach, and no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. A small region of
atelectasis at the left lung base reflects the previous
placement of the chest tube. [**Known firstname 1439**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was paged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 13393**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization,
which revealed triple vessel disease. She had intact LV function
by echocardiogram.  On [**6-21**] she went to the Operating Room where
bypass grafting.  Please see the OR report for details, in
summary she had coronary bypass grafting x5 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the first
diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein double
sequential graft from aorta to the first obtuse marginal and
second obtuse marginal coronary arteries; as well as reverse
saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
artery. His bypass time was 97 minutes with a crossclamp of 81
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the OR to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. He
remained hemodynamically stable, woke neurologically intact, was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated. On POD1 he was
transferred from the cardiac surgery ICU to the stepdown floor
in stable condition. All tubes lines and drains were remover per
cardiac surgery protocol
Once on the stepdown floor the patient worked with nursing and
physical therapy to increase mobility and strength.  The
remainder of her hospital course was uneventful. ON POD4 she was
discharged to rehabilitation at Island Terrace in [**Location 942**],MA.

35-2/7 week GA infant admitted for prematurity

Maternal Hx - 30 year old G3P1->2 woman with PMHx notable for opioid dependancy following surgery earlier this year (currently taking methadone 165 mg daily) and for gestational DM (on Humulin). Prenatal screens were as follows: A positive, IAt negative, HBsAg negative, RPR non-reactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown. Past OB history was notable for pre-eclampsia with previous pregnancy. Social history notable for adoption x 1; denies illicit drug use. Family history is non-contributory.

Antenatal Hx - [**Last Name (un) **] [**2148-2-26**] for EGA 35-2/7 weeks at delivery this evening at [**2066**]. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus treated with Humulin; by methadone use as above; and by IUGR and non-reassuring fetal heart rate, leading to repeat cesarean section under epidural and spinal anesthesia. There was no labor. ROM occurred at delivery and yielded clear amniotic fluid. There was no intrapartum fever or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis and intrapartum antibiotics were not administered.

Neonatal course - Infant was vigorous at delivery. She was orally and nasally bulb suctioned and dried, adn was subsequently pink and in no distress in room air. Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes. ROS otherwise negative/non-contributory
