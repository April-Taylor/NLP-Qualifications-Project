Studies:
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2108-10-23**] 4:58 PM
Reason: line placement
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-23**], 4:08 p.m.

Right PIC line has been removed, new right internal jugular line
ends in the upper SVC and a new left PIC line ends just above
the superior cavoatrial junction. Lateral aspect of the left
lower chest is excluded from the study, other pleural surfaces
are unremarkable. Heart remains top normal size and there is
mild engorgement of pulmonary vasculature but no edema or
interval mediastinal widening or indication of pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ANKLE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT  [**2108-10-23**] 4:59 PM

The ankle mortise is congruent without evidence of fracture.

Osteotomies involving the fourth and fifth metatarsals as well
as resection of the distal fourth ray are unchanged from the
previous exam. No cortical destruction is seen. There is soft
tissue swelling around the ankle and foot, likely representing
edema/cellulitis.

IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling likely indicating cellulitis.
No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.

Approved: TUE [**2108-10-23**] 7:01 PM

ECHO [**2108-10-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. A mass or vegetation on the
mitral valve cannot be excluded. There is probably moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (in part due to the significant MAC).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-12-28**],
the degree of pulmopnary hypertension detected has increased. If
clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended to exclude
endocarditis and to determine the degree of valvular mitral
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F h/o recurrent RLE cellulitis, IDDM, CAD s/p CABG
presents with RLE cellulitis and sepsis. On presentation, SBP
was 86, with lactate 3.6, WBC 19. SBP improved to 120s w/ 2L IVF
and her lactate dropped to 1.4. After 4-5th L IVF, SBP dropped
to the 80s. Was started on pressors and abx regimen of
daptomycin and vancomycin; transferred to MICU. In MICU pressors
weaned off, minimal maint IVF started. Was continued on
daptomycin and vancomycin, which were later changed to
piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin.  The L PICC line, which
the patient had had for 1 month, was pulled and tip sent for
culture. New PICC line placed, pt transferred out to floor.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for blood sugar management. Podiatry was
consulted for surgery once cellulitis improved. ID was consulted
regarding antibiotic regimen.
.
# RLE cellulitis: Pt's erythema and tenderness resolving.
Underwent right 4th metatarsal head resection by podiatry on
[**2108-10-30**]. Bone samples were sent for microbiology and pathology
examination. Pt had bandage takedown by podiatry on POD #2,
cleared for discharge. Sent home on Vancomycin and Zosyn, to be
continued for 2 full weeks post-op, with possible extension to
4-week course pending micro/path results from biopsy specimen
sent from surgery.
.
# Recent sepsis: Pt stabilized after IVF, continued to have
stable BP while on medicine wards.
.
# CAD: Pt was without symptoms of CAD during her hospital stay.
She was continued on her home regimen of ASA, statin, BB, and
ACE-I.
.
# IDDM: Pt's FSBS were uncontrolled, likely given her infection
and then surgical course, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted regarding
adjustments to her home diabetes regimen. After adjustments were
made during the hospitalization, [**Last Name (un) **] recommended changing her
back to her home insulin regimen in preparation for discharge.
She had appropriate control of her FSBS on this home regimen
after her surgery and pre-discharge.

- CAD s/p CABG
- h/o lung cancer
- h/o CVAs


Discharge Condition:
afebrile, vital signs stable, tolerating POs, with improving
pain and resolving infection in the right leg, bandaged and in
post-op shoe by podiatry.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2108-10-23**], for an infection of your right leg
(cellulitis).  You were admitted to the MICU for low blood
pressures that required vasopressors, and you were started on
Zosyn and Vancomycin as antibiotic treatment for your infection.
 In the MICU, you were weaned off the vasopressors and
maintained on IV fluids.  Multiple X-rays of your right leg and
feet showed no evidence of infection in the bone
(osteomyelitis).  An echocardiogram was done, which showed no
evidence of an infection in your heart (endocarditis).  Your
left PICC line was changed, and podiatry was consulted for
surgery of the right foot wound once your infection improved.
You were taken to the operating room for debridement of the
wound, and the head of the 4th metatarsal bone was removed and
sent for microbiology and pathology.  You continued to do well,
and were discharged on a 2-week course of Zosyn and Vancomycin
with close follow-up.
.
During your hospital stay, your blood sugars were also
poorly-controlled, so the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes team was consulted to
help manage your blood sugars.  By the time your were ready for
discharge, your blood sugars were under good control on your
home insulin regimen.
.
If you develop worsening foot pain, redness, swelling, or
warmth, or if you develop fevers or chills, you should call your
doctor immediately and return to the emergency room.
.


Followup Instructions:
You will need to have your Vancomycin trough, ESR, and CRP
checked by the VNA on [**2108-10-31**], with the results sent
to your PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also need to have your CBC, Chem 7, and
LFTs checked once weekly while you are on these antibiotics,
with the results also to be sent to your PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need to
follow-up with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Location (un) 5164**], on Wednesday, [**11-7**], at 10:15AM.
You will also need to follow-up with your Infectious Disease
doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], within the next two weeks.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] should
follow-up on the microbiology and pathology from [**Hospital1 18**] to make
sure that a two-week course of Zosyn or Vancomycin is sufficient
to treat your infection.  Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 24408**] office to make
this appointment tomorrow.
.
From a podiatry standpoint, you will need dressing changes every
other day by VNA, with betadyne and dressing to incision.  You
should also be partial-weight-bearing on the right foot, in the
post-op shoe.

CT abdomen/pelvis:
FINDINGS:
ABDOMEN:  The visualized lung bases are clear. The liver
demonstrates minimal pneumobilia within the left lobe.  Arising
from the caudate lobe of the liver is a hypodense rounded
exophytic mass that
measures 4.3 AP x 6.1 TV x 10.7 cc (2:25 and 601b:40).  It
exerts minimal mass effect on the adjacent liver parenchyma and
duodenum.  There is no surrounding inflammation.  Its appearance
is similar in the axial plane to prior study from [**2149-1-8**].

Clips are present in the gallbladder fossa.  Spleen is normal in
size.
Pancreas and adrenal glands show no masses or nodules.  The
small and large bowel shows no evidence of obstruction or wall
edema.  Neither kidney shows evidence of hydronephrosis.
Multiple circumscribed hypodense structures arise from the
kidney which consist of simple fluid, the largest of which
measures 4.5 cm in diameter in upper pole of the right kidney.
There is no free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy.

PELVIS:  The bladder and prostate appear unremarkable.  The
prostate measures 3.1 x 5.2 cm in the axial plane (2:76).  There
is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

Minimal degenerative disc disease is present in the lumbar
spine.  Otherwise, there is no aggressive-appearing lytic or
sclerotic lesion.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post cholecystectomy and gastric banding without
evidence of free air or free fluid.
2.  Portocaval mass as described above; evaluation with
contrast-enhanced CT may be considered once the patient's renal
function improves.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT (TTE):
[**2150-9-24**] at 10:01:00 AM
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *6.0 cm  <= 5.2 cm
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *6.1 cm  <= 5.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55%  >= 55%
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP):  21 mm Hg  <= 25 mm Hg

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2144-10-2**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Low normal LVEF. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.

CONCLUSIONS:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No clinically significant
pericardial effusion. Low normal global left ventricular
systolic function. No clinically significant valvular
regurgitation or stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-2**],
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is no longer
appreciated. Due to the suboptimal image quality on the current
study a comprehensive comparison of all other parameters could
not be made.

EGD ([**2150-9-25**]):
Indications: 75 yo with recent ERCP/sphx had melena and upper
GIbleed
FINDINGS:
Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted. Cold forceps biopsies were
performed for histology to evaluate for H.pylori.
Duodenum:
 Excavated Lesions A single cratered 2 cm ulcer was found in the
posterior duodenal bulb. No active bleeding was noted.
 Other Duodenoscope was introduced and the site of previous
sphincterotomy. There was clear bile draining from the
sphincterotomy. No bleeding was noted.

IMPRESSION:
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy)
Ulcer in the posterior duodenal bulb
Duodenoscope was introduced and the site of previous
sphincterotomy. There was clear bile draining from the
sphincterotomy. No bleeding was noted.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Clears when awake and advance diet as tolerated.
Protonix 40 mg orally twice a day.
Await pathology for H.pylori. Treat if positive for H.pylori.
Repeat EGD in 4 weeks to document healing of duodenal ulcer. If
ulcer is persistent then obtain biopsies to rule out malignancy.

Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
the ERCP fellow. The patient's reconciled home medication list
is appended to this report. EBL = zero. Final diagnosis as
above. Specimens as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
75 year old male with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib on warfarin, PR
prolongation s/p CCY and more recently ERCP with sphincterotomy
for 1.5cm CBD stone, now presenting with syncope and
hypotension, likely secondary to GI bleed.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# GI bleed: He was initially admitted to the ICU with concern
for active upper GI bleeding with evidence of a HCT drop and
melena.  The ERCP service was consulted and recommended
consulting the GI service for upper endoscopy before attempting
a repeat ERCP.  While awaiting this study, he received the
following infusions: 6L NS IV, 4 units pRBCs, 1 units FFP, and
10mg vitamin K in order to reverse an INR of 2.4. Due to a prior
history of a transfusion reaction, he was pre -treated with
diphenhydramine and transfused at a slower rate. His hematocrit
was followed closely and continued to trend up over the course
of his MICU stay so he was transferred to the floor.  Had EGD
with side viewing scope which showed cratered ulcer at Duodenal
bulb.  Biopsies were taken, GI rec'd: 1. following up in 4 weeks
for rescope to evaluate for healing of ulcer; 2. if H Pylori
positive, will need treatment; 3. continue PPi.
.
# Hypotension: Due to a presumed ongoing GI bleed, he was
admitted to the MICU for observation of his hypotension without
tachycardia. He was felt to be hypovolemic from the GI bleed and
was resuscitated as above.  He did not appear to be septic.  His
blood pressure remained stable throughout his MICU stay.

# Bradycardia/Syncope- His EKGs were initially concerning for a
high-degree AV block, but review of the EKGs with the Cardiology
service revealed atrial flutter with variable conduction
(usually 3:1) as well as known PR prolongation.  TTE was done
and showed stable EF and no effusion.  Troponins trended
downward.  EP consulted who felt no acute intervention was
needed.

# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: INR was supratherapeutic in
setting of coumadin at presentation .Patient appears to have
slow atrial flutter, per EP, and does not require EP
intervention at this time. Reversed with FFP and 10 vitamin K
for EGD. Patient was instructed to restart coumadinon [**2150-9-28**] if
no signs of bleeding/melena. Plans to have INR drawn the week of
[**2150-9-28**] with results sent to his nurse at his anticoagulation
lcinic in FL. They will manage his dosing from there.

INACTIVE ISSUES:

# CAD s/p CABG: Patient was w/o chest pain throughout. Troponins
negative. No evidence of active/acute ischemia on EKG. Home
statin was continued.

# Portacaval lesion: First noted on CT in [**2149**]. Appears stable.
Being followed by PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 108**] with MRI and surgical referral.

# Diabetes: On metformin, saxaglipitin and Januvia at Home.  He
was given insulin sliding scale while in house.

# Hypothyroidism (s/p thyroidectomy): Patient was maintined on
home dose of levothyroxine. No issues while in house.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**],

 It was a pleasure taking care of you during your
hospitalization.  You were admitted with passing out and low
blood pressures.  You were found to have a low blood count and
blood in your stool.  You were given blood transfusions and your
blood count remained stable.  You had an upper endoscopy which
showed a large ulcer in your intestines which was not actively
bleeding, but we believe this was the source of your bleeding.
You will need a repeat endoscopy in 4 weeks to recheck the ulcer
to make sure it is healing.  We also were holding your aspirin
and coumadin because of this bleeding.  You may restart these
medications on Monday [**9-28**] if you are still feeling well and
have no signs of bleeding or dark stools.

Your lap band was deflated by our Bariatric Surgeons in order to
have the EGD.  They said this can be reinflated by your regular
Bariatric doctors.  Please call your surgeon to schedule an
appointment to follow up on this.

You were also noted to have a slow heart rate at times.  You
were seen by our electrophysiologists (heart rhythm
specialists).  They felt this was a benign rhythm and did not
require treatment.  They suggested you follow up with your usual
cardiologist.

Chest CT ([**1-22**])
New 2.5 x 2 cm fluid collection with air-fluid level consistent
with an abscess along the course of a resected segment of the
right dysfunctionalized loop catheter. There is evidence of
infection tracking along the residual loop catheter superiorly.
The entire extent may not be accessed on this study. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
.
Left Arm AV Fistulogram ([**1-25**])
Left AV fistulogram and ultrasound Doppler showed completely
thrombosed AV fistula.
.
Fluoroscopy Guided Placement/Replacement/Removal of Central Line
([**1-26**]):
Uneventful exchange of a short temporary, for a long permanent /
'tunneled' femoral hemodialysis catheter, as above. The catheter
is ready to use.
.
Tunneled Cath Placement ([**2-2**]):
1. Successful exchange of previously placed right femoral
catheter for a new 55 cm 14.5 French dual lumen tunneled
hemodialysis catheter via the right common femoral vein with
termination in the upper IVC at the T11/12 interspace level.
2. Unable to perform AV fistulogram and thrombectomy
intervention at this time, as above.
3. Left IJ vein small in caliber with apparent occlusion
inferiorly, thus tunneled neck line not placed.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Previously seen small abscess in the right subcutaneous
tissue appears smaller on today's study, with small amount of
residual stranding.
2. Loop graft in left subcutaneous chest with surgical staples.
3. No focal consolidation seen within the lungs. No masses
identified. Small amount of extrapleural fat seen in the right
side. Bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Interval worsening of previously described destructive
changes within the spine.
5. Large hiatal hernia.
.
CT Head:
FINDINGS: Image quality is slightly degraded due to patient
motion. Allowing for this, no intracranial mass lesion,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures is apparent.
There is a chronic left pontine lacunar infarct. Mild mucosal
thickening in the posterior aspect of the sphenoid sinus is
present. There is bilateral atherosclerotic calcification of the
cavernous carotid arteries. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are within normal limits. There is thickening of the
posterior pharyngeal soft tissues, possibly secondary to
increased lymphatic tissue, but infectious etiology cannot be
entirely excluded, as opposed to a neoplastic process. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Chronic left pontine lacunar infarct.
3. Thickening of the posterior pharyngeal soft tissues, which
could be secondary to increased lymphatic tissue. An infectious
etiology cannot be discriminated from a neoplastic disorder.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular
systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2125-2-7**], no major change is evident.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 y.o. male with multiple medical problems including HIV, HCV,
ESRD on HD, who presents with clotted left-sided AV graft. The
following issues were investigated during this hospitalization:

.
# Clotted graft: S/P thrombectomy of left chest AV graft, but
reclotted during HD that same night. A temporary right femoral
line was then placed with no complications. An order was placed
to assess the left chest AV fistula, but due to a
misunderstanding, a left arm AV fistulogram was performed by IR
which showed a completely clotted graft. The left arm AV
fistulogram had not been in use for several months. An AV
fistulogram of the left chest was not performed until [**2-2**] and
both this fistulogram and a possible thrombectomy were
complicated by nausea/vomiting under local anesthesia. For this
reason, IR felt uncomfortable proceeding unless the patient was
under general anesthesia.

Additional imaging at this time showed a left IJ that was small
in caliber and occluded, preventing placement of a line in this
location. The patient's only access, a right femoral line had
been inadvertently displaced by the patient and was thus
repositioned and tunneled on [**2-2**]. Because of the multiple
complications with access, no more attempts were made and the
patient continued HD through the tunneled right femoral line.
Other access should be pursued to allow the right femoral line
to come out.
.
# Hypotension/Resp Failure: Post op from the OR for I+D of his
abscess on [**2-6**], the patient was found to be hypotensive and
bradycardic.  He was resusitation in the PACU and transferred to
the MICU.  ABG demonstrated findings consistent with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  Patient was initially intubated and
maintained on a ventilator.  As his respiratory status improved,
the patient was extubated.  His hypotension was initially
treated with pressors.  However, he was weaned from these
medications and maintained his normal BP.  This event was
thought related to peri-op narcotics and GNR bacteremia.  He was
called out to the floor in stable condition.
.
# ESRD on HD: The patient continued in-house HD and was
maintained on Sevelamer.  He has regular HD on Tues, Thurs, Sat
.
# ID: Pt. had a chest wall abscess, positive for MRSA on a
previous hospitalization for which he was treated with
Vancomycin for 14 days. On admission for this hospitalization,
he was found to have a new abscess, also positive for MRSA, for
which he went to the OR for an I&D on [**1-24**]. Given his lack of
venous access, Linezolid was given for MRSA.  However, in the
MICU, blood cultures grew Serratia marcens.  He was also thought
to have C. diff.  Patient was put on Vanco, Gent, Flagyl.  He
ruled out for C. diff x3 stool studies.  His flagyl D/Cd.  ID
was consulted regarding his Serratia bacteremia.  Because follow
up cultures were negative, they recommended stopping his
gentamicin.  They recommended continuing his Vanco to complete
14 day course for MRSA abscess (through [**2125-2-19**]).  He will also
need follow up for his HIV/HCV care.  He is discharged on 750mg
vanco qHD, dosed for trough of 15.  He will also need a VAC
dressing for his chest wound until the wound is healed.  Change
every 3 days.
.
# Delirium: Coming out of the MICU, the patient experienced
delirium, shouting out and thinking that he was driving to
[**Location (un) **].  He was not aggressive.  His delirium was thought
due to infection.  CT head was negative.  He stopped his
percocet but continued his Methadone.  Over the course of 2
days, the patient's delirium cleared.  He was pleasant and
returned to baseline.
.
# HIV: On HAART, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**].
- Continued outpatient Indinavir, Ritonavir, Stavudine
.
# Depression
- Continued Duloxetine
.
# Anemia: Likely related to ESRD.  Pt is given Epo at HD.  His
Hct remained stable in the mid 20s.
,
# DM: Patient experienced multiple episodes of hypoglycemia
while on NPH and an Insulin sliding scale. Per the patient's
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has occurred during previous hospitalizations, usually
because the patient does not adhere to a hospital diet and
relies on his family to bring him food. As a result, he is
either hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic depending on how much and
what kind of food he gets. NPH was discontinued because of
continued hypoglycemia. As hypoglycemia continued, he was
started on a regular diet to encourage PO as well as increase
sugar consumption. His Insulin sliding scale was maintained so
as to cover for any elevated sugars that occurred while on a
regular diet. Pt. was otherwise maintained on Gabapentin for
neuropathy.
.
# Chronic pain/hx heroin use
- Continued outpatient methadone 20 [**Hospital1 **], percocet, which was
down-titrated when he had mental status changes.  We continued
his methadone
.
# HTN: Pt. experienced episodes of hypotension, mostly after HD,
but also separate from HD. His outpatient dose of Metoprolol
12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] was d/c'd as he rarely ever made the SBP goal to
receive it. However, it was restarted on [**1-30**] with holding
parameters because of NS tachycardia and normotensive BPs. He
was hypotense again during his stay in the MICU (see above).
After transfer, his BP medications were added back slowly.  He
seemed to tolerate Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] well.
.
Code: FULL for this admission.

PROXY: patient changed his health care proxy during his

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease with a
myocardial infarction at age 20, also history of diabetes
mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident, who was transferred
emergently to [**Hospital1 69**]
catheterization laboratory from outside hospital.  The
patient was diaphoretic the p.m. of admission, reportedly
took his medicines and went to bed.  He was then found
unresponsive in bed by his family and EMS was called.  He had
a prolonged code in the field by EMS and was given initially
2 mg of Atropine and 6 mg of Epinephrine and was transferred
to the outside hospital Emergency Department.  At the outside
hospital Emergency Department, he was found to be in
ventricular fibrillation and given Epinephrine and followed
by defibrillation times three, followed by Lidocaine and
followed by one more defibrillation attempt, which resulted
in sinus tachycardia with a rate of 140 and systolic blood
pressure of 110/50, and fingerstick of 36.  He then became
hypotensive at 53/35 and developed PEA and was given
Epinephrine times two.  He was then started on Levophed and
Dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].

At the time of transfer, cardiac catheterization revealed
ulceration of the left main artery along with a stump
occlusion of the left anterior descending and diagonal
arteries.  A DS stent was placed in the left main and a
Hepacoat stent was placed in the diagonal.  The left anterior
descending was noted to be totally occluded and could not be
crossed.  He was then transferred to the CCU in critical
condition on multiple pressors, not responsive, with dilated
pupils.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, the patient was transferred
to the CCU in critical condition on multiple pressors
including Levophed and Dopamine.  He was unresponsive with
noted dilated pupils.  Neurology was consulted and
recommended apnea test, which was done and, subsequently the
day after admission, the patient was declared clinically
brain dead.  There was much difficulty in maintaining his
blood pressure.  On [**2169-12-22**], discussion was held with his
family concerning the severe nature of his condition.  It was
decided to withdraw care and he was pronounced dead at 11:05
p.m. on [**2169-12-22**].  The family was present.  Autopsy was and organ
donation were declined.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right thigh wound.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 70-year-old female, with
known peripheral vascular disease and is status post multiple
vascular surgeries, presents to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] office with a
right knee-thigh pain since [**2142-11-10**], and acute
right thigh drainage today, bloody in character. Outside work-
up included knee films which were negative, intra-articular
cortisone injection without improvement to the knee, an MRI
of the spine which demonstrated disk disease. Patient was to
get an epidural injection, but this was not done secondary to
her current symptoms. Patient denies fevers, chills, sweats.
She denies glucose changes. She was seen by her primary care
physician and started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg on [**2142-12-28**]. There had been no changes in the right knee pain. She
is now admitted for post incision and drainage in the office
for IV antibiotics and wound care.

bleed.

MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg once daily, Zoloft 50 mg once
daily, Lasix 80 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily,
Lipitor 80 mg once daily, warfarin 3 mg on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, warfarin 2 mg on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, Humulin-N 50 units q. a.m. and Humulin-
N 35 units at bedtime, with a Humalog sliding scale before
meals and at bedtime, Slow-Iron daily.

ILLNESSES:  Include coronary artery disease status post
coronary angioplasty with stenting of the right coronary
artery in [**2141-12-16**], history of congestive heart failure--
compensated, history of hypertension--controlled, history of

bypass in [**2134**], bilateral right and left femoral popliteals
in [**2127**], a fem-fem bypass with a right SFA endarterectomy in
[**2127**], removal of the fem-fem bypass with vein patch
angioplasty to the PFA in [**2128**], a redo common femoral BK [**Doctor Last Name **]
with 8-mm PTFE in [**2139-11-15**], also a thrombectomy of the
common femoral artery at the same time, a left temporal
biopsy in [**2141-3-16**] which was negative, a jump graft of
right fem [**Doctor Last Name **] to BK [**Doctor Last Name **] with PTFE, and endarterectomy of the
popliteal artery in [**2142-2-13**].

SOCIALLY:  The patient lives with her husband. She ambulates
with a cane. She denies smoking or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  VITAL SIGNS: 138/70, 68, 16, O2 sat 96% in
room air. HEENT EXAM: There is no JVD, a left carotid bruit,
carotids are palpable 2 plus bilaterally. Lungs are clear to
auscultation. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm without
murmur, gallop or rub. Abdominal exam is soft, nontender,
bowel sounds x4. There are no bruits or masses. Peripheral
vascular exam: The right thigh is with a 2x2 opening with
surrounding erythema and warmth to palpation. Pulse exam
shows on the right radial artery palpable 1 plus, femoral 2
plus, DP and PT palpable at 2 plus. On the left, the radial,
femoral, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial are all palpable at
2 plus. NEUROLOGICAL EXAM: Patient is oriented x3, nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. She was placed on bed rest. Wound cultures were
obtained. Routine labs were obtained. Antibiotics of
vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl were instituted. Blood
cultures and urine cultures were obtained. For diabetes, we
continued her current regime. Hemoglobin A1C was obtained. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained. A urinalysis was done to rule
out a UTI. The patient was continued on her antihypertensive
medications. Electrocardiogram was checked initially with no
acute changes. Coumadinization was held in anticipation for
potential further surgical intervention versus diagnostic
procedure. Initial swab grew oxacillin resistant staph, coag-
positive, heavy growth. Sensitivities to Bactrim were
requested, and this was sensitive to vancomycin, Bactrim,
tetracycline and gentamicin. The anaerobe cultures were no
growth. Blood cultures: Initial cultures grew [**1-17**] Staph coag-
positive, oxacillin resistant. The patient's repeated blood
cultures x3 were no growth and finalized. The patient had
urine cultures. She required several samplings until we
obtained an adequate urine for culture which was no growth.

On hospital day #2, patient complained of chest discomfort.
She was alert. Vital signs were stable. EKG during chest pain
showed no acute changes. There was some mild ST depression in
III, AVF, V1 and V2, as compared with the EKG on [**2142-3-18**]. Nitroglycerin relieved the symptoms within 3 minutes. A
repeat EKG was without change.

[**Last Name (un) **] followed the patient during her hospitalization for
diabetic management. Her hemoglobin A1C was 7.9. Infectious
disease was consulted for recommendations for appropriate
antibiotic therapy and length of therapy. Patient was
continued on current therapy. A vascular lab ultrasound
secondary to carotid disease and no follow-up in 2 years.
This showed a moderate plaque in the right internal carotid
artery and the left, the right being greater with narrowing
of the right of 40-59%, and on the left 60-69%. There was
normal left vertebral antegrade flow, and the right vertebral
was occluded. Patient had an MR of the lumbar spine obtained.
There were no abnormal signals within the vertebral bodies.
There was some loss of signal in L3-L4, L4-5, L5 and S1.
Intervertebral disk indicates some degenerative changes with
minimal loss of height in 3 and 4, with no significant
bulging of the disk. Significant disease was noted in L5 and
S1 with intervertebral disk loss and focal right base
protrusion and herniation into the spinal canal causing
displacement and compression of the S1 nerve root sleeve.
There was mild compression of the thecal sac at this level.
There was no abnormal signal within the disk to suggest
diskitis. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal.
There is no evidence for abscess, or other fluid collections.
The patient's aortobifemoral graft was identified.

The patient had an MRA of the aorta and pelvic vessels and
the right leg vessels. The abdominal aorta was unchanged in
appearance. Renal arteries: Right there were 2, on the left
it was singular and were patent. The celiac and superior
mesenteric were patent. Aortobifemoral bypass was widely
patent throughout, originating from the distal infrarenal
aorta proximally and midway between the origin of the renal
arteries and the native bifurcation. The graft shows no
narrowing into its anastomosis with the common femoral
arteries bilaterally, where there are clip artifacts. There
are no collaterals to suggest high-grade stenosis. The native
distal aorta to graft origin remains patent with some
irregularity. There was irregularly, as well, within the
bilateral common iliacs which remain patent until the level
of the bifurcation. No internal iliac arteries could be
identified. On the right lower extremity, there is a
pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral just beyond the
insertion to the right aortobifemoral artery graft which has
increased in size. It now measures 13-mm in diameter and 60-
mm in length. Previously, it was a 9x16. The profunda on the
right is patent. The right fem above-knee popliteal graft
shows mild narrowing proximally just distal to the
pseudoaneurysm, and it returns to normal caliber within the
proximal thigh. It is widely patent to the distal thigh where
the jump graft originates. Jump graft from the fem above-knee
popliteal graft to below-knee popliteal graft is completely
thrombosed. Throughout its entire extent, there is extensive
enhancement surrounding the occluded graft which occluded
distally at its anatomosis to below-the-knee popliteal and
medially at its origin which extends into the surface of the
skin where the patient's ulcer is located. This is highly
suggestive of infectious cause with an infected graft.
It is uncertain, however, whether these areas are infected,
and which have reactive enhancement from thrombosis. There is
no drainable fluid collection seen within this area. The
abnormal enhancement extends around the femoral above-knee
popliteal graft at the site of the jump graft origin, and the
femoral above-knee popliteal graft remains patent. At this
area through moderately narrowed proximally 50% to the
femoral, above-knee popliteal graft was patent to its
anastomosis with the above-knee popliteal, and the above-knee
popliteal artery is patent to the top of the prior
pseudoaneurysm just beyond the femoral condyle. Collaterals
are not well seen around the jump graft or the above-knee
popliteal artery occlusions. The anterior tibial and
posterior tibial arteries appear to be patent. The anterior
tibial and common peroneal  and posterior tibial trunk is
reconstituted by collaterals. The anterior tibial does not
fill the DP. However, the posterior tibial does remain patent
into the foot. The peroneal artery is minimally patent
proximally, and does not extend beyond the midcalf. Left
lower extremity, the aortofemoral graft is patent throughout
its anastomosis with the femoral artery. The origin of the
profunda femoris is patent; however, there is a small
pseudoaneurysm at its origin measuring 8-mm in diameter which
is slightly increased in size from prior study. The left fem
below-knee popliteal artery graft is widely patent throughout
its course without evidence of focal stenosis. There is mild
narrowing of the native left anterior tibial artery without
high-grade stenosis. The common peroneal, posterior tibial
trunk is widely patent, and the posterior tibial artery is
widely patent throughout its course. The peroneal artery is
patent proximally and extends to the distal calf where it
gives off some collateral branches to both posterior tibial
and anterior tibial arteries. The anterior tibial artery
fills the dorsalis pedis which is diminutive but patent. The
posterior tibial artery fills plantar arteries with a
dominant lateral plantar branch that is patent. There is
edema within the vastus lateralis bilaterally and adjacent
muscles that is nonspecific. There is no other significant
muscle edema except for in the areas around the affected jump
graft and packed cavity.

Patient was evaluated by the cardiology service for
perioperative risk assessment. They felt that a Persantine-
MIBI was not indicated at this time, as there is probably
100% chance that it would be positive. Its only value would
be to determine size of ischemic defect, probably not small,
from EKG changes. The patient is at a high risk, but surgery
is unavoidable. Recommendations to transfuse to correct
anemia for hematocrit greater than 30, maintain her systolic
pressure in 120s-130s, maintain pulse rate in the 60s or
less, and proceed with surgery known at a higher risk.

Patient underwent on [**2143-1-7**] an excision of the PTFE
jump graft and wound debridement. She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. She
required 2 units of packed red blood cells for a
postoperative hematocrit of 21.4. She remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care.

Postoperative day 1, post-transfusion crit was 22.6.
Initially ran [**Company 5249**]-max of 100.1-99.9. The initial wound was
repacked and dressed. Patient remained in the VICU, Swan'd,
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells. The glycemic
control was excellent. Serial CKs were flat. Troponins were
0.18, 0.18, 0.23. EKG was without further change. Patient was
continued on current management. Patient continued to be
followed by [**Last Name (un) **] service. Patient required IV nitroglycerin
for systolic hypertension. Post-transfusion crit was 26.9.
Patient's diet was advanced as tolerated. Diuresis was
continued. Patient was continued on antibiotics and remained
in the VICU for continued monitoring and care.

On postoperative day 3, T-max was 1003. The patient's Swan-
Ganz was converted to a triple-lumen. Diuresis was continued.
She was transfused another unit of packed red blood cells,
and electrolytes were repleted. Post-transfusion crit was
30.6. Diuresis was continued with IV Lasix. Reglan was begun
p.o. The patient was continued to be followed by infectious
disease.

Postoperative day 4, the levofloxacin and Flagyl were
discontinued. Patient continued to be diuresed. Her
hematocrit was 33.0 and stable. Her exam was unremarkable.
She had a Dopplerable DP and PT on the left, and a
Dopplerable DP on the right. Ambulation to chair was begun.
She was tolerating p.o.'s. IV fluids were Hep-Locked. She had
an excellent urinary output. Foley was discontinued at
midnight. She continued to be diuresed. O2 sats were
monitored, and O2 weaned. With adjustments in her insulin
dosing, her hyperglycemia improved. Final recommendations
from ID was that the patient should continue for a total of 6
weeks of IV vancomycin from the date of removal of the graft,
which was [**1-7**]. The vanco trough should be monitored
weekly along with a CBC, diff, BUN and creatinine. The trough
goal is [**10-4**]. These results should be faxed to the
infectious disease department at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**]. Patient has
been instructed to follow-up with infectious disease clinic
in [**Month (only) 958**], and the number has been given to the patient to
call for an appointment time. A PICC line was placed on
[**2143-1-11**] for continued antibiotic therapy.

Remainder of the hospital course was unremarkable. The
patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26453**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-1-11**] for elective
surgical management of his aortic valve and coronary artery
disease. He was taken directly to the operating room where he
underwent an aortic valve replacement and two vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He developed atrial fibrillation for which amiodarone
was started. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. He was diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. He developed a left forearm intravenous
infiltrate which was treated with warm compress, elevation and
keflex with improvement. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He was ready for discharge to rehab on POD #6.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Left pleural effusion with adjacent relaxation atelectasis.

Early developing pneumonia in this region cannot be entirely
excluded. There is mild volume overload. Repeat radiography
following appropriate diuresis may be of benefit to assess for
this possible underlying infection.
.
Echo: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] outpatient Hem/[**Hospital **]
clinic for treatment of metastatic leiomyosarcoma. She received
Decadron and Pepcid pretreament and then ARQ 171. Her husband
then found her unresponsive and called nursing staff. She was
found to be pulseless and was immediately defibrillated. A code
was called. She responded to one shock with restoration of NSR,
BP and SA02 - BP 100's/70's, SaO2 96-99% on oxygen. She did not
require intubation but was briefly mask ventilated. She received
2g Mag given the the prolongation of QTc from 438 to 458 after
ARQ 171 administration, but no other intravenous medication. She
was admitted to the ICU.
.
In the ICU, she was placed on telemetry and given fluids given
SBP's in 90's, with improvement of her BP. Her lisinopril was
held. An ABG showed no acidemia. However, she did have a gap
acidosis with bicarbonate compensation. There was no evidence of
renal failure, uremia, dka, or history of ASA ingenstion to
account for acidosis. Her lactate was high - likely lactate B
due to malignancy, which may have accounted for her acid-base
status.  Her CXR showed no new findings, no pneumothorax, no
widened mediastinum, no dilated heart. Her cardiac enzymes where
flat. An echo was performed to look for an arrthymogenic
metastasis; although it was a poor study, no wall-motion
abnormalities suggestive of a metastasis where found. A PE was
thought to be unlikely as she would have to have had a massive
PE with RV dysfunction (not seen on EKG) and would not have
recovered so quickly or had normal O2 saturations. She received
serial EKG's showing initially prolonging QTc 438 (prior to
arrest)-458 (at arrest)-468 (next day) which then decreased to
448 on day of discharge. Cardiology was consulted and were able
to trace her arrhythmias around the time of arrest. Per
discussion with cardiology, they noted PVC's after administraion
of ARQ 171, then QT prolongation and then an R-on-T followed by
assytole. Based on these findings, it was thought that ARQ 171
most likely caused Torsades and cardiac arrest. She was not
placed on any medication as her long QT was resolving and as the
inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was removed. She remained asymptomatic the rest
of her hospital course without chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis or
palpatations. She was discharged with close cardiology follow
up.

Discharge Medications:
1. Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8
hours) as needed.


Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Cardiac Arrest
Leiomyosarcoma


Discharge Condition:
improved, stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were diagnosed with cardiac arrest. We believe that you
experienced cardiac arrest because of an abnormal rhythm called
long QT that occured because of the chemotherapy [**Doctor Last Name 360**] ARQ 171.
Your QT interval is no longer prolonged at this time. However,
you will need to have the QT interval monitored closely.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your oncologist for a follow up appointment

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Increased Ostomy Output, nausea/vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular triple lumen catheter placement,
revision, and replacement by Interventional Radiology
1 unit packed red blood cell transfusion


History of Present Illness:
34 yo F with pmhx significant for Crohn's disease s/p near-total
colectomy and ileostomy, PE/UE DVT on lovenox with recent
hospitalization [**2196-6-3**] - [**2196-6-18**] for stomal pain and found to
have fungemia/bacteremia now s/p portacath removal who presents
to the ED with persistent stomal pain, increased stool output
and nausea/vomiting.
.
Patient was last admitted from [**Date range (3) 110642**] for abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased ostomy output. During that
admission she underwent ileoscopy, endoscopy and flexible
sigmoidoscopy which were normal and showed no signs of active
crohns; infectious work-up was negative and MRE was unrevealing.
Inflammatory markers were normal and her steroids were tapered
(initially started on methylprednisolone 20 iv q8h for presumed
crohns flare), which she finished on [**2196-6-20**]. Colorectal
surgery thought patient had a stomal prolapse however should not
be causing the degree of pain she reported.  Ultimately thought
that the pain was due to irritation of the stoma due to
increased stool output.  Patient offered reversal of ostomy and
has appointment on [**2196-7-7**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 **] to
discuss (wanted infection to clear prior to OR).  Patient
started on loperamide to decrease stool output.  Blood cultures
during that admission grew Staph epidermidis as well as [**Female First Name (un) 564**],
and she was started on a course of Linezolid and Fluconazole;
Linezolid was planned to be finished on [**2196-6-26**] (although
patient finished yesterday) and Fluconazole on [**2196-6-28**] (still
taking). Patient's portacath was removed and a right IJ TLC was
placed for acess during the remainder of her hospital stay.
Patient has very poor access and has required multiple
portacaths.  Found to have a RUE axillary and left IJ DVT for
which she is managed with lovenox, reportedly non-compliant as
an outpatient (although denies this).  While awaiting insurance
authorization of Linezolid she left against medical advice,
however obtained prior auth as an outpatient.

Since discharge, the patient reports that she has continued to
have stomal pain, worse with passage of stool.  Pain describd as
burning/pressure pain.  Also with increased stool output, watery
without any visible blood although reportedly guaiac positive at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] per patient.  Patient finished her prednisone taper on
[**2196-6-20**] with no change in symptoms.  Also with one day of
nausea/vomiting, unable to take po.  Denies any fever, chills,
cp or sob.
.
ED: initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] ED where a small piv was
placed and patient given 500 cc of NS until iv access lost.
Given po zofran and IM dilaudid.  Labs drawn and significant for
normal wbc's, sodium 133 and K+ 3.1.  No LFTs drawn.  Patient
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Vitals: 98.8  108P  107/61  16  99%RA.
Given zofran 4mg ODT x 2 and dilaudid 1mg IM.

[**6-26**] CXR:

IMPRESSION:  Persistent unusual medial course of right internal
jugular
central venous catheter, which courses more medially than a
previous right
internal jugular venous catheter present on prior chest x-rays
and CT scans in
[**2196-5-15**].  Position on lateral view excludes internal mammary
vein location
and suggests a central venous location, but inadvertent arterial
placement
cannot be excluded.
.
KUB [**6-27**]:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
.
[**6-27**] MRI chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal areas of thrombosis within the venous system of
the upper
extremities bilaterally including near total occlusion of the
SVC and left brachiocephalic vein by thrombus, and non-occlusive
thrombus in the right internal jugular and at the junction of
the right internal jugular and subclavian veins on the right.
Left internal jugular vein is completely occluded, with numerous
collaterals visualized.
2.  2.5 x 1.6 cm retropharyngeal fluid collection in the
cervical spine,
concerning for reaccumulation of the patient's prior abscess.
Re-evaluation with dedicated MR of the neck with contrast is
recommended.
3.  3.3 x 1.9 cm subcutaneous hyperintense area relative to
skeletal muscle on [**Name (NI) 91308**] images in the region of the prior
placement of the port, presumed to be a hematoma.
The pertinent findings were discussed Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the
covering
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] telephone at 5:30 p.m. on [**2196-6-27**].
.
[**6-28**] RUQ u/s:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic ductal
dilatation to
suggest cholestasis.
.
[**6-29**] replacement of TLC:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Uncomplicated SVC gram demonstrating near-complete occlusion
of the mid to lower SVC, non-occlusive thrombus extending into
the left brachiocephalic vein, multiple venous collaterals.
2.  Uncomplicated replacement of the old 7 French 15 cm
triple-lumen central venous catheter with a new 7 French 20-cm
triple-lumen central venous catheter, with its tip in the upper
right atrium.  Catheter is ready for use.
.
[**7-4**] MRI c-spine:
IMPRESSION:  Study is quite limited by motion artifact, but
demonstrates:
1.  Ill-defined fusiform fluid/edema in the prevertebral space,
extending from
the C1 through C7 level.  This is, overall, less marked than on
the previous
MR study of [**2196-5-17**] and demonstrates no definite rim- or
internal enhancement
to suggest true collection or abscess.
2.  No finding to suggest spondylodiscitis or its complications,
such as
epidural phlegmon or abscess.
3.  Normal cervical spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal
intensity.
.
COMMENT:  These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
([**Hospital1 18**]
hospitalist, covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**], the requesting
clinician) via
telephone, at 1745 H on [**2196-7-3**].  Apparently, the patient has
known ""SVC syndrome"" with documented venous thrombosis, over the
entire time period dating to early [**Month (only) 547**], which likely accounts
for the persistent retropharyngeal/prevertebral edema.
As discussed, in this setting, the role of continued dedicated
imaging of the cervical spine and soft tissues is unclear.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**7-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of obstruction or abscess.  Stranding around
ileostomy is
unchanged since [**2196-5-29**] and is likely chronic.
2.  Simple free fluid within the pelvis.
3.  Hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver, too small to
characterize, most likely a cyst.
4.  Multiple collateral vessels in the right subcutaneous
tissues which
correlates with patient's history of known bilateral IJ and
subclavian
occlusion
.
[**7-5**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-6-14**],
findings are similar.
.
[**7-7**] R/IJ:
CONCLUSION:
1.  Placement of a triple-lumen central venous line into the
right atrium over the guide wire through the existing access in
the right internal jugular vein.
2.  The line is ready to use.
.
[**7-10**] KUB:
Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.  There is air and stool seen
throughout colon.  No dilated loops of small bowel are
identified.  Bony structures are intact.  There is no free
intra-abdominal gas seen on the left side downdecubitus
radiographs.
.
[**7-11**] MRI necK:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Ill-defined fluid/edema in the prevertebral spaces from
C1-C7 is
significantly decreased since the prior exam.  No evidence of
abnormal
enhancement.
2.  Stable degenerative changes of the cervical spine, and mild
downward
displacement of the cerebellar tonsils.

Brief Hospital Course:
## Venous thrombosis/SVC syndrome: MRV showed large amount of
clot burden in upper central venous system with total occlusion
of left IJ and subtotal occlusion of the right IJ and SVC.  She
was on Lovenox at home and was transitioned to a heparin gtt
this admission.  Given her difficult access, a right IJ was
placed by the MICU attending on the floor prior to transfer.
This was changed for a longer 20cm line by IR while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
and was functioning well at the time of transfer.  The etiology
of her extensive clotting was thought to be a combination of
hypercoagulability from her Crohn's, endothelial damage from her
multiple prior ports and potentially a familial thrombophilia.
Heme/onc was consulted regarding her extensive thrombus and
recommended continuing heparin drip while in house with plans to
transition to coumadin WHILE BRIDGING FOR A MINIMUM OF 48HRS. In
addition, should the patient become subtherapeutic ever, she
WILL REQUIRE REBRIDGING WITH IV HEPARIN OR LOVENOX AT 100MG [**Hospital1 **].
IR is planning to take her for angioplasty, kissing stent
placement, and port placement for a planned admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
the day after her IV antibiotic course is complete (see below).
The vascular service was consulted, however, the team felt that
there was no current indication for thrombectomy and no
procedures should be performed until either the patient has been
line free x1 month or at least until after her abx course is
complete. She will need to be transitioned back to either
lovenox or IV heparin prior to her IR admission. As all of the
thromboses have been line-related, the Hematology service did
not recommend ordering a hypercoagulable work-up, although this
may be considered at a later date given the history of
thrombophilia in her mother and brother. The hematology service
will be following up with the patient in about 3weeks after
discharge.
-STARTING COUMADIN 5MG ON [**7-14**]. SHE HAS BEEN ON A CONTINUOUS IV
HEPARIN INFUSION. SHE WILL NEED TO BE BRIDGED FOR AT LEAST 48HRS
WHILE THERAPEUTIC. SHOULD ABSORPTION OR RECURRENT N/V BECOME AN
ISSUE OR PT IS TO BECOME SUBTHERAPEUTIC, SHE WILL NEED TO BE
BRIDGED WITH IV HEPARIN OR LOVENOX 100MG [**Hospital1 **]. SHOULD ABSORPTION
BECOME A RECURRENT ISSUE, PT SHOULD THEN BE PLACED ON LOVENOX
100MG [**Hospital1 **] WITH A FACTOR 10A LEVEL TO BE CHECKED AFTER 3RD DOSE.
.
## access issues-pt has very complicated vascular access. See
above. There was much debate among the vascular service, IR,
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (line specialist), and ID as what would be the
best approach for the patient. There was some consideration of
removing the pt's R.IJ (that has been changed over a wire twice)
and placing temporary, possibly tunneled, groin access. However,
this was felt to place the patient at high risk for infection
given her prior infections and prolonged planned course of IV
abx. In addition, should she clot groin access, she will be left
in a difficult place as she no longer has any upper extremity
access (other than R.IJ above).Therefore, it was decided to keep
her current temporary R.IJ in place while continuing antibiotic
therapy and anticoagulation. Then, the patient is to return for
a scheduled admission to [**Hospital1 18**] the day after her antibiotics are
complete ([**2196-8-5**] or [**2196-8-8**]) for an IR procedure to place
kissing stents, angioplasty and for port placement.
.
## High-grade Enterobacter bacteremia: Patient developed
worsening abdominal pain and fevers. Blood cultures grew
pan-sensitive Enterobacter. Started on Zosyn but was
persistently bacteremic. Thus, the ID service recommended
switching to Meropenem for better clot penetration as there was
concern of superinfected thrombosis. (there is no plan for
thrombectomy/intervention at this time) At that time, the
original internal jugular catheter was exchanged over a wire.
THis was then performed a second time. The first negative blood
culture after these measures were taken was [**2196-7-8**]. Surface
ECHO was negative for vegetations. CT abdomen was unremarkable
for intraabdominal fluid collection to suggest a GI source. The
ID team followed the patient closely during admission. The ID
team has recommended 4 weeks of IV meropenem. Pt should have
weekly safetly labs (cbc with diff, chem 7, LFTs) while on
meropenem. Pt should have a repeat blood culture with gram stain
the day the antibiotics are to be completed. Last day of therapy
for 4 week course is [**2196-8-5**]. PT WILL NEED REPEAT BCX AND GRAM
STAIN DAY ABX COURSE IS COMPLETE.

## Retropharyngeal fluid collection on MRI: Concern for abscess.
 ENT/IR felt this was a reaccumulation of a previous hematoma
from port placement and thought that instrumentation to that
area could introduce infection.  With no fevers/leukocytosis it
was decided to have repeat neck imaging which showed a decrease
in the size of the fluid collection.

## Elevated LFTs: RUQ was unremarkable and her LFTs were stable,
it was thought to be [**3-17**] her recent antifungals.  Hep B showed
immunization, Hep C was negative.

## Stomal pain/increased stool output: She had an extensive
work-up for her stoma pain and high ostomy output last
admission, all of which was negative, with no evidence for an
active Crohn's flare. Surgery was consulted but did not feel
that an ostomy take down was indicated at this time. Pt is under
the assumption that she can be considered for take down after
her acute medical issues have resolved.  GI was following and
did not have any further recommendations.
-pain regimen includes gabapentin, lidocaine patch, PO dilaudid
prn. Of note, pt reports pain at times despite the regimen.
There was concern at one point during her hospitalization that
she was tampering with her infusion of IV dilaudid, as they are
hung in a minibag and not pushed. She has periods of ""Stoma""
pain with n/v that seem to be cyclical in nature and last for a
few days then resolve without intervention. During periods of
quiescence she does not require any pain medication. Zofran and
compazine were given for nausea. Pt was started on gabapentin
and a lidocaine patch.
.
## Prior [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia, Staph epidermidis bacteremia: per
discharge summary patient was to continue linezolid for 10 days
after port removal which was [**2196-6-24**] (port removed [**2196-6-15**]) and
fluconazole for 14 days after port removal until [**2196-6-28**]. She
was switched to Micafungin through the end of her course given
LFT abnormalities. Courses complete.

## Anemia: microcytic, hct within baseline, no brbpr or melena
but guaiac + stool at [**Hospital1 **] per patient.  Hct initially 37, but
dropped to 23 with hydration which was previous baseline. Given
1U PRBC transfusion for Hct 19 but not actively bleeding at that
time. HCT was 22.3 on the day of DC. Further work up can be
pursued in the outpatient setting.

## Sinus tach: HR mostly in the 90-110s, which is chronic and
likely due to her extensive clot burden. Resolved.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 24 M w/ presented to OSH 5 days prior to admission w/
abdominal pain, fever, nausea and diarrhea and was found to
havean abscess of his R buttock. Pt states he had a recent binge
of alcohol for several days and after sobering had significant
pain from the affected area and into his testicles. He was
admitted to the hospital on [**5-10**] and started on IV antibiotics
(levo/tigecycline) without resulotion of his symptoms. CT was
obtained and demonstrated an abscess which was I&D'd, but the
patient failed to improve s/p I&D. A repeat CT scan on [**5-13**]
demonstrated tracking of his fluid collection along the
peritoneum into the R abdominal rectus muscle. OSH cultures grew
group b strep. Since this admission, his testicular pain has
resolved, although he continues to have significant pain from
his buttock/I&D site. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management of his tracking infection.  He has never had
a previous lesion like this and no immediate family members or
contacts have reported similar lesions. There is remote FH of
similar disease in his sister (years past), and he has had no
recent travel.

CT Pelvis [**2174-4-17**]: Fluid collection extending anterior to the

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted from the emergency department from
outside hospital. The CT Abdominal CT scan preformed at an
outside hospital [**2174-5-15**] showed progression of abscess to include
left rectus,lateral to bladder, anterior to bladder with air
fluid levels. The patients white blood cell count was elevated
to 12.4 on admission. The patient was started on Vancomycin and
Zosyn. On [**2174-5-16**] the patient was taken to interventional
radiology where CT guided drainage was preformed and a pigtail
catheter was placed, which drained approximately 400 ml of
odorous grey/light brown drainage which was sent for gram stain
and culture which showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, gram
positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters as well as gram
negative rods. The MRSA screen was negative. Later these culture
showed Beta Streptococcus disease was consulted for antibiotic
and management recommendations. After drainage of this
collection the patients condition began to improved. His pain
was treated effectively on the floor with pain medications by
mouth. On [**2174-5-18**] output from pigtail drain was noted to drop
significantly which was concerning that the drain had become
blocked or misplaced. The patient was taken back to
interventional radiology on [**2174-5-20**] where a repeat CT scan was
preformed and showed persistent fluid collection and the drain
was upsized which put out a moderate amount of purulent, foul
smelling drainage. The output from the drain again slowed
despite the larger catheter size and continued fluid collection.
[**2174-5-20**] an additional pigtail drain was placed in interventional
radiology which began to effectively drain the abdominal
collection and  a repeat CT abdomen on [**2174-5-23**] showed a decrease
in the size of the abdominal fluid collection. Throughout this
time, the patient was followed closely by infectious disease who
monitored the patient's laboratory values and recommended
Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and [**Last Name (un) 28487**] intravenously. The patients
clinical presentation continued to improve and his wihte blood
cell count progressively decreased. Upon discharge, the patient
was sent home on an appropriate oral antibiotic regimen
recommended with ID with appropriate ID follow-up. Through out
the hospital coarse, the patient had a difficult personality and
social work was consulted for recommendations and access the
patients ability to care for himself. His report of serious
alcohol abuse pre-operatively was also very concerning. Social
work saw the patient and offered increased emotional support.
The patient was discharged home with the drains in place, and
per nursing, was able to flush and care for the drains with help
of a visiting nurse.

Labs noted
Nutrition:  120 cc/kg/day TF.  Feeds started on DOL 1; currently @ 10 cc/kg/day BM/SSC 20, increasing 10 cc/kg/[**Hospital1 **].  PN started via PIV on DOL 0; lipids being added today.  Projected intake for next 24hrs from PN ~54 kcal/kg/day and ~2.8 g pro/kg/day and ~1.1 g fat/kg/day.  From EN:  ~13 kcal/kg/day, ~0.2 to 0.4 g pro/kg/day and ~0.7 to 0.8 g fat/kg/day.  GIR from PN ~6.5 mg/kg/min.
GI: Abdomen benign.  No spits.

A/Goals:
Tolerating trophic feeds without GI problems so far; advancing feeds slowly and monitoring closely for signs of feeding intolerance.  Labs noted and PN adjusted accordingly.  Tolerating PN with good BS control.  Initial goal for PN is ~90 to 110 kcal/kg/day, ~3 to 3.5 g pro/kg/day and ~3 g fat/kg/day.  PN to advance as per protocol and tolerance.  Initial goal for EN is ~150 cc/kg/day BM/SSC 24, providing ~120 kcal/kg/day and ~3.2 to 3.3 g pro/kg/day.  Expect PN to taper as EN feeds advance towards goal.  Further increases in feeds as per growth and tolerance.  Appropriate to add Fe and Vit E supps when feeds reach initial goal.  Growth goals after initial diuresis are ~15 to 20 g/kg/day for wt gain, ~0.5 to 1 cm/wk for HC gain, and ~1 cm/wk for LN gain.  Will follow w/ team and participate in nutrition plans.

   Assessment of Nutritional Status
   Pt at risk due to: NPO / hypocaloric diet
   Estimation of current intake: Inadequate
   Specifics:
   Pt w/ pancreatitis. s/p extubation [**1-19**].  Pt was receiving TF for
   nutrition support via post pyloric feeding tube.  Feeding tube was
   found coiled in stomach therefore no longer in post pyloric position so
   TF held.  OGT was to suction, d/c
d and replaced w/ NGT.  Pt w/ > 3
   liters of output from NGT [**1-19**].  Consulted for TPN recommendations as
   surgery recommends continuing to hold TF while NGT is high.  Per d/w MD
   (MICU team), possible plan to d/c Dobhoff (that was previously feeding)
   and keep NGT in to suction.  Agree w/ TPN for now, but would consider
   re-trialing enteral feeds.
   Medical Nutrition Therapy Plan - Recommend the Following
   Multivitamin / Mineral supplement: via TPN
   Tube feeding / TPN recommendations:  Recommend TPN: 1.2L 150g dextrose/
   70gAA/ 40g lipid
   If good BS control, advance to goal TPN of 80 kg 3 in1 std : 2L
   340gdextrose/ 120g AA/ 40g lipid = [**2099**] calories and 120g protein
   Recommend consider advancing Dobhoff into post pyloric position and
   resuming enteral feeding
   Check chemistry 10 panel daily
 adjust lytes in TPN PRN
   Re-check triglycerides [**12-31**] propofol

Service:  Neonatology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Baby Girl [**Known lastname 4068**] is a 36 1/7 weeks 2605 gm female newborn who
was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for
management of possible small bowel obstruction.

This infant was born to a 34 year old gravida 3, para 2
mother.  Prenatal screens, blood type A positive, antibody
negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR
nonreactive, Rubella immune, Group B Streptococcus status
unknown.  This pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios
and suspected duodenal atresia.  Mother was transferred from
[**Name (NI) 41498**] Hospital to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further evaluation.  A fetal scan at [**Hospital6 649**] showed multiple distal dilated small bowel
loops consistent with jejunal atresia.  The biophysical
profile was eight out of eight, nonstress test reactive.
Amniocentesis was performed for fetal lung maturity (47) and
cytogenetics.

Socially, the family is intact.  Mother lives with husband.
Two other children born at full term, both are alive and well
([**2188**], [**2190**]).

Rupture of membranes with clear fluid, about 22 hours prior
to delivery.  No maternal fever.  Intrapartum antibiotics
were started 18 hours prior to delivery.  The infant was
delivered under epidural anesthesia.  This was a vaginal
delivery with a facial presentation.  Infant was vigorous
with spontaneous cry.  She was dried and received bulb
suction, stimulation and provided brief blow-by oxygen.  Apgar
scores were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes of age.
The infant was shown to the parents and then transferred to
the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 2,605 gm,
length 49.5 cm, head circumference 33.5 cm.  Vital signs,
temperature 98.4 rectally, heartrate 166, respiratory rate
44, blood pressure 75/36 with a mean arterial pressure of 47
and oxygen saturation in room air 95%.  Dipstick on admission
64.  Infant alert, pink, nondysmorphic.  Anterior fontanelle
was soft and flat.  Positive frontal bossing and forehead
bruising, both most likely related to fetal positioning and
presentation.  Normal-set ears, left lobe with lobe cleft.
Palate intact.  Neck supple without lesions.  Lungs slightly
coarse but good aeration bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate
and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur was auscultated.
+2 femoral pulses bilaterally.  Abdomen soft and flat.  None
to minimal bowel sounds.  Normal preterm female genitalia.
Patent anus.  No sacral anomalies.  Hip lax with bilateral
clicks, yet negative Ortolani and Barlow.  Extremities, pink
and well perfused.  Still with some acrocyanosis.  Tone,
strength and movements normal and symmetrical.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - The infant in room air not
requiring any oxygen, oxygen saturations consistently greater
than 95% on room air.  Breathsounds clear and equal.

Cardiovascular - A murmur was auscultated, the blood pressure
has been stable for duration of hospitalization.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Upon admission to the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit intravenous fluids of D10/W were
initiated at 80 cc/kg/day.  A KUB was performed shortly after
admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit showing a
gastric bubble and minimal distal air.  A nasogastric tube
was placed shortly after admission to the Newborn Intensive
Care Unit and putting out large amounts of clear gastric
contents.  Minimal abdominal distention.

Hematology - Hematocrit 45.1, infant has not received any
blood products during his brief hospitalization.

Infectious disease - Complete blood count with differential
and blood cultures were drawn upon admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.  White blood cell count was 16.8,
hematocrit 45 with 57% neutrophils and 2% bands and a
platelet count of 332.  Blood culture was drawn as well and
is pending.

Neurology - Head ultrasound not indicated at this time.

Sensory - Hearing screen has not yet been performed.

Baby medications were given, Vitamin K and Erythromycin eye
ointment were administered shortly after admission to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and initial PKU was drawn at
less than 24 hours of age.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable in room air.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with a history of lupus, who had 5-6 months of crescendo
angina escalating to angina with minimal exertion while at
work as a surgical Intensive Care Unit nurse at the [**Hospital3 28333**] [**Hospital3 **].  The patient was scheduled to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1445**] today and had chest pain while in his office.  At that
time the EKG revealed diffuse T wave inversions in the
precordial leads.  She was going to be a direct admission to
the floor but she had recurrent chest pain and was admitted
to the cardiac catheterization lab.  Upon further
questioning, she reports that she had had 8 episodes of
angina usually exertional over the last several months.  On
two nights prior to admission she had midline chest pain
radiating to her left neck at work but we cannot get a
further history at this time due to patient's weakness.

Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] was brought to the cath lab where she underwent
stent to the LAD, 90% lesion with good result.  Immediately
post procedure she had an EKG demonstrating AIVR with right
bundle branch block morphology which resolved.  Then upon
arrival to the holding area, she had a bradycardic episode
with systolic blood pressure decrease and unresponsiveness.
Prior to this, her EKG had persistent precordial T wave
inversions with prolonged PR intervals.  During her rest she
had a brief course of chest compression and was subsequently
given Atropine which brought her blood pressure up to the 100
systolic and her pulse  up to 90.  She subsequently had
recurrent chest pain [**1-20**] and bedside echo revealed no
effusion.  She was alert and awake at this point and was
transferred to the CCU.  Hematocrit was 41 pre-procedure.
Repeat was 27, although she had no physical evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed.  She did have a large groin hematoma.
In CCU her blood pressures remained stable with systolic
blood pressure in the 120's to 130's and a repeat hematocrit
was done while we were waiting for the type and cross which
returned at 32.  The patient remains chest pain free.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pre-cath is significant for occasional
palpitations, no left lower extremity edema, no PND, no
syncope, positive occasional dizziness.  The patient is very
active running three miles per day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed
about 20 years ago by joint pains and pancytopenia during
that flare.  She also had a history of seizures since a
teenager but none times 30 years.

MEDICATIONS:  At home are just Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  Tegretol which causes anaphylaxis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She works as a SICU nurse at the [**Hospital3 28333**].  She denies smoking, alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died of an MI at age 46, mother
has a history of Q wave MI, her brother has right bundle
branch block and hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Showed vital signs with temperature
97.0, heart rate 77, blood pressure 122/63, respiratory rate
15, 100% on two liters nasal cannula.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck,
no JVP.  Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Coronaries,
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6
systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, non distended, no flank ecchymosis.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2+ DP and PT
pulses bilaterally.  She has a right femoral hematoma about 2
cm in diameter with surrounding ecchymosis and a 2+ pulse.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission were significant for her
initial hematocrit of 42.8, but repeat at 17:46 was 27.1 and
then at 19:15 was 32.6.  Her ESR was 25, her CK was 87,
troponin less than .3.  Her echocardiogram showed an EF of
45-50% with mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 1+ MR
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pulmonary hypertension.  Cath showed a wedge
of 12.  LAD had severe proximal disease and 70% at the distal
portion of the lesion, 95% proximal portion with appearance
of a clot and/or plaque avulsion.  Stent led to 0% residual.
She also had a small diseased ""side branch"" diagonal I which
was attempted but not entered.   RCA showed 60% mid lesion,
90% tubular lesion at the bifurcation into short PDA and
posterior left ventricular branch.  Left circumflex showed a
tubular 50-60% lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  56-year-old female with remote history of
SLE, positive family history for coronary artery disease
presents with crescendo angina and EKG with diffuse T wave
inversion, status post catheterization showing three vessel
disease with a stent to the LAD.  Post cath was complicated
by a question of a vagal episode with bradycardia and a
hematocrit drop from 42 to 32, likely delusional, however,
there was concern for retroperitoneal hematoma.

1.  Cardiovascular - Ischemia:  Her Integrilin was
discontinued secondary to acute blood loss and concern of
bleed.  She was continued on Aspirin and Plavix and started
on Pravastatin for an LDL of 150 and HDL of 60.  He was
transfused one unit packed RBC's.

Date of Birth:   [**2082-8-5**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old male with
a history of prior cardiac catheterization in [**2141**].  He had a
70% left anterior descending lesion and a stent to a 90%
right coronary artery lesion at that time.  His
catheterization at that time was complicated by distal
embolization, a small clot associated with significant
inferior wall ST elevation.

The patient was managed medically until recently where he
reported shortness of breath and chest pain when he climbs
his stairs at night.  He said it did not occur when walking
up the stairs during the day.

In addition, he wakes up in the middle of the night with pain
occasionally.  The pain was relieved with sublingual
Nitroglycerin.  It started the first week in [**Month (only) 359**],
approximately six weeks prior to admission.

Stress test on [**2150-12-18**], showed a small fixed defect
at the inferior base, moderate inferolateral ischemia, and a
small anteroseptal ischemia, with an ejection fraction of
64%.  He had chest pain and drop in his blood pressure during
the test and was referred in for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Prior right coronary artery stent.
2.  Coronary artery disease.  3.  Cerebrovascular accident.
4.  Hypertension.  5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Cozaar 100 mg alternating with 50
mg q.d., Tiazac 300 mg p.o. q.d., Prevacid p.o. p.r.n.,
Lescol 80 mg p.o. q.d., Ziac 5/6.25 mg p.o. q.d., Aspirin 81
mg p.o. q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to cardiac catheterization white
count was 8.6, hematocrit 44.2, platelet count 237,000;
sodium 144, potassium 5.1, chloride 109, bicarb 31, BUN 21,
creatinine 1.3, blood sugar 98.

[**Last Name (STitle) 53795**]went cardiac catheterization on the day of admission,
[**12-21**].  The catheterization revealed 99% left anterior
descending obstruction, 80% circumflex obstruction, and 99%
obstruction of the right coronary artery.  He did receive
Angio-Seal for closure of the right femoral arterial puncture
site.  Ejection fraction by the prior stress was 64%.  He was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for coronary artery bypass
grafting.

On the day of catheterization, his creatinine was down to
1.1, potassium of 3.6, hematocrit 36.9, with a white count of
8.3, PT 12.9, INR 1.1, LFTs were normal.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute
ischemia.

On exam the patient had some right arm weakness which
resolved spontaneously at the time of his cerebrovascular
accident in [**2136**].  He denied any further neurological
symptoms, although he had been told that his carotids were
""partially blocked.""'

He denied any asthma, cough, or production of sputum
problems.  [**Name (NI) **] did have some gastroesophageal reflux with
occasional ...................

He denied any other diabetes, thyroid, or hematology issues.
On exam he was neurologically grossly intact.  His lungs were
clear bilaterally.  His heart sounds were normal with S1 and
S2 with no murmur noted.  His abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  His extremities were warm with
positive peripheral pulses and no edema.

The patient was also seen by the CMI attending, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Carotid ultrasounds were performed on [**12-22**],
the day prior to surgery, which showed mild plaque in the
right and left internal carotid arteries, with less than 40%
stenosis, as well as tortuous right and left internal carotid
arteries, with normal antegrade flow in both vertebral
arteries.

On[**12-23**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times two by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with a LIMA to the left
anterior descending and a vein graft to the posterior
descending artery.  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On the afternoon after the operation, the patient was
lethargic but arousable.  The patient was following commands,
and was provided occasional Neo-Synephrine and Nitroglycerin
support on and off.  Urine output was good.  Lung sounds were
coarse, but the plan was to go ahead and wean and extubate
the patient, as the vent was being weaned at the time.  The
patient was extubated without event over night, on
postoperative day #1.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was on an Amiodarone
drip for atrial fibrillation at 0.5 and Neo-Synephrine drip
at 0.75.  After administration of the initial Amiodarone, the
patient dropped his urine output and was given a fluid bolus.

Postoperative labs revealed a white count of 24.2, hematocrit
27.5, platelet count 240,000; sodium 136, potassium 4.2,
chloride 105, bicarb 24, BUN 32, creatinine 1.8, blood sugar
105.  Creatinine had risen from 1.2 to 1.8.

The heart beat was irregular, as the patient was in atrial
fibrillation.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Abdominal and
extremity exams were benign.

The patient had beta-blocker increased to 25 b.i.d.  He was
extubated and had an oxygen saturation of 96%.  His exam was
otherwise unremarkable.

Pulmonary toilet was begun, as well as getting out of bed
with Physical Therapy and the nurses.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had a T-max of 99.1??????.
He was in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 99 with an
oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Creatinine
came down slightly to 1.7.  White count came down to 16.9.
Hematocrit was stable at approximately 25.7.  The exam was
unremarkable.  The patient's beta-blockade was increased.

The patient remained on Amiodarone drip and a Heparin drip
while he was in atrial fibrillation.  An EP consult was
called.  The patient continued with Lasix diuresis also at
that time.

The recommendation was to continue the Amiodarone and Heparin
drip and possibly consider giving Coumadin for six weeks,
given his prior cerebrovascular accident and hypertension, in
addition to his current atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day #4, the patient had a heart rate of 101
and atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure of 127/74 on a
Heparin drip, Amiodarone and Metoprolol.  White count
remained stable at approximately 15.  He had a hematocrit of
26.

The patient was stable.  Beta-blockade was increased to
Metoprolol 75 b.i.d., and adjustments were made to the
Heparin drip, and the patient was transferred out to the
floor in the afternoon on postoperative day #5.  The patient
had no complaints.

The patient had atrial fibrillation over night and then went
back into sinus rhythm in the morning in the 90s, with an
oxygen saturation of 94%, with a blood pressure of 124/70.
Creatinine dropped slightly to 1.6.  Other labs remained
relatively stable.

The plan was for the patient to get cardioversion.  Heparin
was increased to 1300/hr after Heparin bolus was given with a
plan for cardioversion pending the results of the PTT after
the Heparin adjustments were made.

On [**12-28**], the patient had cardioversion performed by
Cardiology without any event or any complications.  On
postoperative day #6, the patient had no complaints.  He was
back in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 78.  He was
alert and oriented in no apparent distress.  His chest wound
had slight sanguinous oozing in an approximate area of 2 x 2
cm.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm, despite going in and
out of atrial fibrillation.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.

Follow-up coags were ordered with plans to discontinue the
Heparin drip.  Levofloxacin was added in for the drainage at
the sternal incision.  Pacing wires were discontinued.  Diet
was advanced.  The patient was out of bed and ambulating with
Physical Therapy and the nurses.  The patient was seen by
Case Management.

On postoperative day #7, the patient was on day #2 of
Levofloxacin and remained on the Heparin drip at 1100, as the
patient was back in atrial fibrillation.  Heart rate was 76,
and blood pressure was 140/68.  He had an oxygen saturation
of 95% on room air.

His wound exam was unremarkable.  The wound was clean, dry,
and intact.  There was scant discharge from the wound.  The
day prior the wound was cleaned.  White count was 12.5.

At that point, the patient was doing well.  Coumadin dosing
had begun.  The patient continued on a Heparin drip pending
being therapeutic on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.

The patient was continued on Flomax, and the Foley catheter
was discontinued at midnight with urinalysis sent off to
check.

The patient was seen by Social Work on consult.

Foley was discontinued at 4 a.m., and the patient was able to
void.  At that time, over night on [**12-30**], the patient
was back in sinus rhythm with some premature atrial
contractions.

On postoperative day #8, the patient was in sinus rhythm at
81 with a blood pressure of 133/65, with an oxygen saturation
of 97% on room air with an unremarkable exam.

The patient continued on beta-blockade, as well as
Amiodarone.  He continued to work on increasing his
ambulation.  The patient remained in the hospital so that the
INR could be therapeutic for the atrial fibrillation.

The patient was transfused a unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 22.8.

On postoperative day #9, the patient was awake, feeling good.
He was afebrile.  Creatinine was stable at 1.6.  White count
was 13.8, and hospital course was 25.6 posttransfusion.  He
continued with Coumadin therapy with an INR of 1.3 on that
day.

On postoperative day #10, the patient was feeling nauseous
over night and had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation in
the morning and then went back into sinus rhythm at 67 with a
blood pressure of 140/60.  He appeared to be not feeling well
that morning and somewhat tired.  His wounds were clean, dry,
and intact.  His lungs were clear.  His INR rose to 1.6.
Heparin drip was discontinued.  Coumadin therapy was
continued.  Zofran was given for his nausea.

The EP fellow came back to reevaluate the patient for his
recurrent atrial fibrillation, and they spelled an Amiodarone
protocol for him for his dosing, and the recommendations were
noted.

The patient also had a little bit of drainage from one of the
left saphenectomy sites on postoperative day #11.  He had
intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation the day prior.  His
exam was otherwise unremarkable.

Lisinopril ACE inhibitor was added with plans set if the
blood pressure were to drop, Norvasc could be discontinued.
Plans were made for outpatient [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor.

The patient continued to ambulate.  The patient had a little
bit of tenderness in the left leg incision.

On [**1-4**], postoperative day #12, the patient's exam was
as follows:  The lungs were clear.  Heart was regular, rate
and rhythm without murmur.  Incisions were clean, dry, and
intact.  The sternum was stable.  White count was 13.8,
hematocrit 25.6, platelet count 286,000; sodium 139,
potassium 4.4, chloride 104, CO2 28, BUN 22, creatinine 1.6,
blood sugar 93.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 11832**] was for the patient to be discharged home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor with reporting to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2357**].  t
was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**1-29**]

CERVICAL SPINE CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The bones are severely demineralized. There is a comminuted
fracture of the vertebral body of C2, which extends through the
base of the odontoid (odontoid fracture type III, which is
unstable). The odontoid fragment is displaced anteriorly by 4
mm. A small posterior fragment of C2 vertebral body is displaced
into the spinal canal (series 2, images 20-21) without any
significant narrowing of the spinal canal. The fracture extends
into the left vertebral foramen.

There are minimally displaced fractures of the right and left
lamina and the spinous process of C7. There is a nondisplaced
fracture of the left lamina of T3. No definite fractures are
identified at C5, although severe demineralization limits
evaluation.

Mild loss of vertebral body height, disc space narrowing,
degenerative endplate changes and facet arthrosis is present at
multiple levels. Disc/osteophyte complexes at C3/4, C4/5, and
C5/6 result in mild narrowing of the spinal canal.

The left mastoid is underpneumatized compared to the right and
partially opacified. There is a retention cyst in the right
maxillary sinus. The patient is intubated. The thyroid gland is
diffusely enlarged and heterogeneous with multiple nodules.

Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 698**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 4:00 p.m. on [**2146-12-27**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted C2 fracture involving the odontoid (type III
odontoid fracture), which is unstable. The fracture extends
through the left vertebral foramen. If there is a clinical
concern for vertebral dissection, MRA may be performed for
further evaluation.
2. Fracture of bilateral posterior elements of C7.
3. Fracture of left T3 lamina.
4. Partially opacified left mastoid air cells.
5. Diffusely enlarged and nodular thyroid. Further evaluation by
ultrasound is recommended, if not performed previously.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bronchoscopic-guided tracheostomy
tube placement.

PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration of
secretions.

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Tracheostomy tube placement and
therapeutic aspiration of secretions.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was prepped with lidocaine applied to the
endotracheal tube. A flexible bronchoscope was introduced
through the ET tube and into the airway. There were a
moderate amount of secretions throughout the airways which were
therapeutically aspirated. There were no endobronchial lesions
up
to the subsegmental levels. Bronchoscopic imaging was then
performed in order to guide a percutaneous tracheostomy tube
insertion.  After the trachesotomy, a minimal amount of bloody
secretions were removed with the bronchoscope.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

PROCEDURE:  Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Need for long-term nutrition.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, the patient was given a single dose of vancomycin 1
gram IV, and was placed on a 45-degree angle. The patient was
already sedated with propofol and mechanical ventilation. The
gastroscope was inserted through the oral cavity and passed
through the esophagus into the stomach. The mucosa was
entirely normal with no obvious lesions.

The skin over the left upper quadrant was palpated, and a
sharp indentation with 1 finger was seen, as well as
excellent transillumination. The skin was prepped with
chlorhexidine and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Local
anesthesia was employed with 1% lidocaine at the left upper
quadrant site. An Angiocatheter was inserted under direct
vision, and a snare was lassoed and pulled back through the
esophagus and into the oral cavity. A 20 French PEG tube was
loaded and pulled back through the oral cavity in the
esophagus and through the abdominal wall. The gastroscope was
reinserted to confirm excellent placement with a mushroom cap
against the abdominal wall cavity. Bolsters were placed at 3
cm to secure the PEG tube.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with DM, HTN, s/p pacer placement for
complete heart block transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on the date of
admission, s/p a fall 2 days prior to her arrival. In the
incident, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was vacuuming at home and fell backwards,
striking her head against toilet.  She denies loss of
consciousness. A CT head was without acute changes, and the pt
was noted to be dehydrated and had LLL PNA.  A CT C spine showed
C2 and C5 laminar fractures, and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for neurosurgical evaluation.  At time of transfer, pt
reportedly had no neuro deficits, was able to move all
extremities, and c/o neck pain at times. She was initially
admitted to the wards for ongoing treatment. Shortly after her
admission, she was noted to have increasing O2 requirements.
She was tachypneic to the 30s-40s, worse with being woken up.
Her O2 requirement - initially 94% 4L NC - increased to 93% on
6L NC, then up to 97-98% on 100% NRB.  At the time of eval, she
was 95% on 12L and she was transferred to the MICU for closer
monitoring with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
.
Her MICU course, by problem:
[**Age over 90 **]F with DM, HTN, s/p pacer, with hypoxemic and hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
#  Respiratory Failure - Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a persistent ventilator
requirement throughout her MICU stay, eventually requiring
placement of a tracheostomy tube and percuteaneous gastrostomy
tube. CT scans of the chest showed pleural effusions and she
completed two separate courses of antibiotics
(vancomycin/cefepime) for evolving pneumonias. She remained
intermittently dependent upon ventilator support and now
tolerates trach collar for longer periods of time, particularly
in the daytime hours. Bronchoscopy did not show cause for her
persistent requirement. She will need to continue antibiotics
for a total 14 day course (started [**2147-1-11**]).
.
#  Low grade fever and leukocytosis-  Felt to be related to her
bacteremia, likely stemming from pneumonia. She grew coag
negative staph from her blood cultures on [**2147-1-11**]. She was
treated with vancomycin and cefepime. A BAL grew only
oropharyngeal organisms. Urine cx on [**1-12**] +yeast
.
#  C-Spine fractures - Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18095**] a C2 fracture,
extending up to the odontoid, and a C7 fracture in her initial
fall. She was evaluated by neurosurgery and felt not to be a
candidate for halo placement given her age and comorbidities.
She was placed in a hard cervical collar, which will remain for
3 months from the date of injury. She will need to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, approximately 4 weeks from
discharge. A Head CT was negative for intracranial injury.
.
#  chronic kidney disease - Baseline Cr not known- stable.
.
#  DM2 - Pt is on oral hypoglycemics at home (metformin), which
were held during her hospitalization to allow for better control
of her glucose levels. She may be restarted on her meds as an
outpatient.
.
#  HTN - Her home regimen antihypertensives were held and IV
medications were used as needed for BP control.
.
#  Code - Ms. [**Known lastname **] is full code, this was confirmed with son
[**Name (NI) **].
.
#  Communication - son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 71019**]

temperature 102.0, heartrate 92, blood pressure 135/55,
respiratory rate 11.  He was intubated, sedated and his
ventilated.  His ventilator settings were SIMV with pressure
support, title volume of 800, rate 10, positive
end-expiratory pressure of 5 and FIO2 60%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white
blood count 12.8, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11 and 33.3,
platelets 462, MCV 90, sodium 142, potassium 4.9, chloride
106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 61, creatinine 2.8, glucose 105.
Creatinine kinase 181.  Chest x-ray at presentation was
pending.  AST 51, ALT 30, alkaline phosphatase 271, total
bilirubin .6, INR 1.0, PTT 26.6.  Arterial blood gases 7.50,
30, 158 pO2, 24 bicarbonate.

Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and no major
changes noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 74 year old male with a history
of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, status post open
reduction and internal fixation for left trochanteric
fracture, coronary artery disease, chronic renal
insufficiency who presented with worsening shortness of
breath times one day and was also noted to be febrile to 102
on admission.  Etiology of his shortness of breath was
concerning given his congestive heart failure history and
cardiac versus pulmonary secondary to pneumonia as such.

Cardiac - Coronaries, cycled enzymes were negative and he was
ruled out.  He was continued on Aspirin, beta blocker and
Amlodipine.  Pump, he was given Lasix for diuresis which was
able to get extubated without any difficulty and he was
weaned off oxygen, now down to 2 liters, started two days
before discharge and starting to have increased wheezing.  He
was started on nebulizers which seemed to help but also
decreased urinary output most likely to fluid overload, so on
the day before his discharge his Hydralazine was increased to
75 q.i.d. and he was started on a nesiritide to better
perfuse the kidneys since his creatinines were bumping and
also to decrease his afterloads.  His goals the day before
discharge was 1 liter negative and he has been followed with
daily weights.

Blood pressure - He is normal sinus rhythm, he has history of
intermittent atrial fibrillation.  Since admission he is on
Amiodarone and beta blocker for now and continuing to be
checked on Telemetry.

Pulmonary - The day before discharge he was initially
extubated without any difficulty and weaned off of the oxygen
without any difficulty.  On the day before discharge he was
on 2 liters of oxygen but continued to have extreme wheezing,
bilaterally diffuse and he was started on scheduled
nebulizers which helped the patient and will continue with
the nebulizers when discharged to the rehabilitation center.
He was also started on nesiritide for afterload reduce and
perfuse kidney further which decrease in volume overload will
help his pulmonary status.

Infectious disease - He has been afebrile since admission.
He had a temperature of 102 but has not had one since.  He
was started on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and to
continue a 14 day course.  He has been on day #4 now and is
to continue ten more days upon discharge to rehabilitation.

Neurology - He has baseline dementia of unknown etiology,
questionable.  He is alert and oriented intermittently.
Questionable if dementia secondary to a current metabolic
disorder or his baseline or new baseline.  Neurology will
follow closely and Neurology recommended it is most likely
secondary to metabolic disorder, partially secondary to his
baseline now.

Renal - In terms of his renal status he now has an acute
renal failure secondary to his chronic renal insufficiency.
His baseline creatinine is about mid 2s to .5, now he is
bumped up to 4s and this is most likely secondary to Lasix,
possibly decreased volume to his kidneys.  He is started on a
nesiritide data before discharge to better perfuse the
kidneys, also Renal Consult Service was consulted to put in
their input.  Their input was appreciated.  Will continue to
follow his creatinine closely.  He may need hemodialysis at
some point.

Endocrine - For his diabetes he was continued on his fixed
dose of insulin and also regular insulin sliding scale with a
q.i.d. fingerstick glucose.

Diet - For his diet he was being repleted for his
electrolytes prn.  He was kept on a cardiac, renal and
diabetic diet.

Prophylaxis - Prophylactically he was given proton pump
inhibitor, bowel regimen and heparin subcutaneously.  He did
well and was in stable condition upon discharge to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was discharged to rehabilitation
center.  The patient was instructed to follow weights daily
and to call his medical doctor if his weight had increased
more than 3 pounds and to adhere to a 2 gm sodium diet very
strictly and also a fluid-restricted diet and to seek medical
attention as needed if new symptoms or old symptoms return.
He was also to follow up with his primary care physician
early next week, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25154**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure, no major surgical
invasive procedures done except intubation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 times two, 162 mg q.d.

7.  Miconazole powder b.i.d., apply to region as needed
8.  Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d.
9.  Amiodarone 200 mg, two tablets b.i.d., 400 b.i.d., to
change after one week to q.d. by primary care physician at
the rehabilitation center
10. Levofloxacin 250 mg q.d. for the next ten days
11. Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg q.d.
12. Metoprolol 75 mg t.i.d.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 20756**] was admitted for acute shortness of breath.  After
and initial evaluation, he was felt to be septic, possibly from
his hemodialysis line, and was started on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were initiated, the patient had a
central line placed, and was given IV fluid boluses to maintain
his blood pressure.  He was intubated for respiratory failure.
When IV fluids proved insufficient to support a MAP greater than
65, pressors were started, first norepinephrine and subsequently
vasopressin and phenylephrine.  The patient also developed a
number of rhythm abnormalities, including second degree heart
block and ventricular tachycardia, and frequently alternated
between these.
He was coded multiple times during the night of his admission,
with episodes marked by bradycardia and sudden, severe drops in
blood pressure (into the 30's and 40's systolic).  He generally
responded to fluids and increased pressors, but the overall
trend was worsening hemodynamics despite increasingly aggresive
resuscitation.  He was eventually started on dopamine in
addition to the aforementioned pressor agents, yet he continued
to clinically decompensate with worsening bp.  His family, who'd
been involved and apprised of the situation throughout the
morning, was contact[**Name (NI) **] and decided to make him comfort measures
only.  Once the pressors and ventilatory support were withdrawn,
he quickly expired.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD,
hypertension, severe PVD s/p bilateral BKA, and LVH with LVOT
who is presenting with acute shortness of breath. She was in her
usual state of health until earlier this evening when she
noticed that she ""just didn't feel right."" When she went to lay
down, she noted the onset of shortness of breath.  She denied
chest pain or palpitations. She had her last HD session on

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD,
severe PVD, LVH with LVOT obstruction presenting with shortness
of breath and pulmonary edema.
.
# CAD:
Although patient has with multiple CAD risk factors, prior
non-invasive and invasive testing showed no significant
obstructive coronary disease.  A troponin of 0.04 in the context
of normal CK and EKG with no ST-T changes was likely demand
ischemia secondary to hypertensive heart disease. Admission EKG
did not show signs of active ischemia and the patient was
monitored on telemetry and continued on aspirin and statin.
.
# CHF:
The pt's hypoxia was attributed to CHF and not pneumonia as she
denied any cough, and was afebrile and lacking a consolidate on
chest xray. Pulmonary embolism was also unlikely as the patient
is on chronic anticoagulation.  Due to chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure and a physiologic HOCM that leads to
hypotension during dialysis sessions, it is most likely that the
patient developed pulmonary edema  in the setting of volume
status change while receiving dialysis.  Her oxygenation status
improved significantly following blood pressure and rate control
and a dialysis session. There are no PFT's to support the
diagnosis of COPD, but marked hyperinflation on CXR and notable
smoking history indicated strong possibility of COPD
contributing to patient's symptoms so patient was treated with
home dose of spiriva and albuterol as needed. The patient was
weaned on BiPap and began to breathe comfortably on room air
following dialysis.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:
The pt was anticoagulated with coumadin and rate controlled with
metoprolol and diltiazem for her history of atrial fibrillation.

.
# Hypertension:
The patient's hypertension was also controlled with diltiazem
and metoprolol and following a successful dialysis session her
lisinopril and irbesartan were restarted.
.
# Diabetes:
For her diabetes the patient was continued on her home dose of
NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Hyperkalemia:
The patient has end stage renal disease and receiving HD.  The
patient was orginally volume overloaded and on day two of
admission developed hyperkalemia to a K of 6.7.  She had no
peaked T waves or QT prolongation on EKG and received calcium
carbonate and D5/insulin as well as dialysis.  Her electrolytes
were monitored closely with subsequent K between 4.1 and 5.0.

# Heme:
On admission labs the patient was erythrocytotic. Prior
evaluations had not shown renal mass that could contribute to
over production of erythropoietin and on [**2163-5-30**] the epo
level was low normal which would suggest a MPD such as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Patient would benefit from heme follow up as an outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2176-5-24**] she underwent ECD renal transplant. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. She received induction immunosuppression
consisting of ATG, Solumedrol and cellcept. A double J ureteral
stent was placed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed into the
retroperitoneum. Please refer to operative note for complete
details. Of note, she had a labile BP throughout the case with
slow response to pressors. After the renal artery was clamped,
BP dropped to 40s /20s with very slow to no response to
phenylephrine adn ephedrine with acutely depressed ST segments.
Two liters of saline were infused rapidly with ectopy noted on
EKG (mostly pacs). BP increased to 160s and ectopy resolved.
CK/troponins were checked and were wnl. ATG was stopped. She was
transferred to the SICU for monitoring postop. She was extubated
without incident and transferred out of the SICU once stable.

The kidney was oliguric and creatinine did not drop. She
experienced delayed graft function necessitating resumption of
hemodialysis. The foley was removed. Simulect was given on pod1
as ATG had been stopped intraop during the hypotensive episode.
Simulect was repeated on pod 5. Steroids were tapered per
protocol. Given that she did not receive ATG and that simulect
was used, prednisone 20mg qd was continued.  Cellcept continued
and prograf was started on [**5-24**]. Prograf was up titrated to 8mg
[**Hospital1 **] by pod 4 ([**5-28**]) for trough level of 9.9.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. Vital signs remained stable. JP
drainage (serosanguinous)decreased allowing for removal on [**5-29**].
The incision was without redness/drainage. She was assisted OOB
to ambulate with rolling walker. PT was consulted and declared
her safe for discharge home with PT visits.

[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted for hyperglycemia due to steroid.
Lantus and humalog insulin were given with improved control. She
and her husband were taught insulin administration. VNA services
were arranged for assistance at home.

of a term gestation born to a 47 year-old gravida II, para I,
now II mother. Prenatal screens: B positive, antibody
negative, hepatitis surface antigen negative, rubella immune,
PRP nonreactive, GBS unknown. Mother maternal history notable
for insulin dependent diabetes was complicated by
amniocentesis performed by AMA revealing karyotype of 47XXX.

Infant was born with scheduled repeat section on [**11-27**].
Mother was not in labor and no sepsis risk factors were
identified. Infant emerged vigorous with Apgars of 8 and 9.
She was initially admitted to the newborn nursery with stable
Dextrostix, however, she had persistent tachypnea and
retractions and was referred to the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit.

length 18.7 inches, head circumference 34.5 cm. General:
Warm, dry infant, active with examination. Mild respiratory
distress at rest with tachypnea. Skin warm, pin, no rashes,
nondysmorphic. Nares appear intact. Palate intact. Fontanelle
soft and flat. Neck supple without lesions. Chest: Well
aerated, clear, positive retractions. Intermittent grunting
and flaring. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur
audible. Femoral pulses 2+. Abdomen soft, no
hepatosplenomegaly, 3 vessel cord. No masses. GU: Normal
female. Anus patent. Extremities, hips and back normal. Tone
and activity appropriate for gestational age. Intact Moro and
grasp.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory:

for tachypnea. Pulse oximetry revealed hypoxemia which was
treated with nasal cannula O2. She remained in nasal cannula
O2 for a total of 4 days at which time she transitioned to
room air. The cause of this oxygen need was thought secondary to
presumed pneumonia. She continues in room air at this time
without issue. She did have a few episodes on admission of apnea
and bradycardia. Last documented episode was on [**2189-12-2**]. She has been without apnea and bradycardia since that
time.

intervention.

Hematology: Hematocrit on admission was 47.2.

Infectious disease; CBC and blood culture were obtained on
admission. CBC was benign. Blood cultures remained negative
at 48 hours. In light of chest x-ray concern for tachypnea
versus pneumonia and persistent O2 requirement, infant was
treated for a total of 7 days with ampicillin and gentamicin.
Lumbar punctures were attempted but were unsuccessful.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**12-4**]. She was treated
for a total of 8 days of ampicillin and gentamicin.

given a dose of IV solumedrol, then converted to PO prednisone
60mg, to be tapered over 5 days.  He was also started on a 5d
course of Azithromcyin. He was continued on nebulizers and
inhaled steroids.  He will need PFTs as an outpatient, as he has
never had these before. Pt improved clinically (was weaned off
O2 supplementation) and was discharged with ambulatory sats in
90-92% range.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having a COPD
exacerbation.  You were started on prednisone pills to help
decrease the inflammation in your lungs, which will make you
feel better.  The prednisone will be tapered, as directed below.
 You were also started on an antibiotic, which yo ucan continue
to take at home as directed below.  Finally, it is important
that you continue to take your inhalers as prescribed.  Please
keep your follow-up appointment with your primary care doctor as
shown below, as you may need a referral to a pulmonologist for
further treatment and monitoring of your COPD.

As we discussed, you have a predisposition towards diabetes, and
the prednisone can increase your blood sugars. It is important
that you keep with the diabetic diet, not just cutting back on
sugars but also cutting back on starches such as potatoes.

Please remember to have your PSA drawn at your primary care
doctor's office to screen for prostate cancer, as you were
planning on doing, because you have a strong family history.

You have been through a very difficult time.  Please call your
doctor or return to the ED if you ever have any thoughts of
hurting yourself.  Also, seek immediate medical attention if you
have fevers, increased shortness of breath, wheezing, productive
cough or any other concerning symptoms.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

- Please START taking prednisone 60mg x 1 day, then 40mg x 2
days, then 20mg x 2 days, then stop
- Please START taking azithromycin 250mg x 2 days
- Please start Nicotine Patch daily
- Please start Thiamine 100 mg daily
- Please start Folic Acid  1 mg daily
- Please start Multivitamin daily
- Continue your other home medications as before including
inhalers

   blood loss s/p repeat ex-lap, extubated yesterday. Overnight had some
   periods of confusion, medicated for pain with boluses fent/morphine
   PRN. Today was able to get OOB twice, still complains of pain and was
   saying she was having hallucinations with the morphine boluses so pain
   management has been switched to dilaudid. She has also had problems
   with nausea and vomiting due to ileus and has been treated with zofran
   PRN. She had head CT done because of altered mental status (very
   drowsy) and disconjegate gaze. Head CT showed no acute intracranial
   hemorrhage.
   Pt was seem by lactation specialist today and we have been asked to
   make sure she pumps Q2.5-3hrs today.  Her husband has been given
   instructions on how to do this and she has also been given instructions
   but she is too weak and not coordinated herself to do it so nursing
   needs to do this with her Q3hrs. Due at 8PM and 11PM this evening.  I
   tried to call the lactation nurse to see if we need to do this through
   the night or if we can let her sleep. They did not answer my page so I
   think if we plan to do it once or twice through the night that should
   be sufficient. Pumping both breasts for 20 minutes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
male with a history of upper GI bleed, acute renal failure,
who was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 1444**] in early [**Month (only) 956**] with an
upper GI bleed.  At this point he was found to have a
superior mesenteric artery aneurysm as well as gastric
duodenal artery bleed.  The gastric duodenal artery was
embolized.  The patient presents on [**2-20**] with abdominal pain,
it was intermittent sharp and dull abdominal pain.  He went
to the [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency Room and was transferred to
the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 69**]
where he was found to have decreased white cells, stable
hematocrit and LFTs were improving from his previous
admission.  Abdominal CT in the Emergency Room showed
decreased hematoma compared to prior CT as well as some
pericholecystic fluid.  Surgical team was consulted.  Patient
was admitted to the hospital.

pneumothorax, immune complex glomerulonephritis, acute renal
failure, peptic ulcer disease, SMA aneurysm with
retroperitoneal hematoma, [**2151-1-29**] pneumonia, [**2151-1-29**]
increased bilirubin with biliary sludge, status post
percutaneous stent in [**2151-1-29**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**].

pressure 150/80, pulse 88, 91% on room air, respirations 18.
He was fatigued and mildly uncomfortable, alert and oriented
times three.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  HEENT exam was otherwise unremarkable.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Chest showed
slightly decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases,
otherwise clear.  Heart was regular without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  GI showed positive epigastric and right upper
quadrant tenderness, no guarding, slight rebound tenderness
in the epigastrium.  There are bowel sounds present.  Abdomen
was soft, guaiac positive.  Extremities showed 2+ edema
bilaterally.  Neuro, cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Upper extremities and lower extremities showing [**5-2**]
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 138, potassium 3.3,
chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 92,
white count 13 down from 16 upon discharge, hematocrit 26

Chest x-ray showed improved alveolar pattern, question of
left lower lobe atelectasis vs consolidation as well as small
bilateral pleural effusion.  Abdominal CT showed gallbladder
with minimal pericholecystic fluid, pancreas is unremarkable.
Hematoma 8?????? by 5.5 cm slightly decreased from discharge in
mid [**Month (only) 956**], slight thickening adjacent to colon.  His stent
in his common bile duct with associated pneumobilia.  This
was a contrast negative CT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GI:  Patient was taken to the OR for concern over a
re-bleed of his SMA aneurysm.  This was unable to be fixed by
the vascular surgery service.  Based on its proximity to the
pancreas, the patient subsequently underwent SMA artery
aneurysm on [**2-22**] with interventional radiology service.
Other GI issues during this admission were the presence of
the two biliary stents by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19731**]
was aware of his prolonged hospital course and planned to
remove the two some time during the patient's upcoming
rehabilitation stay.  Patient had a PEG tube placed on [**3-23**]
and was tolerating tube feeds.  At the time of discharge he
was also beginning to tolerate solid po intake with only
intermittent vomiting.  Pancreatic enzymes which had been
elevated earlier in the hospital course came down to normal
at the time of discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was in the SICU with poorly
controlled hypertension from [**2-20**] to [**3-8**] and was started on
Labetalol as well as Captopril and Isordil and Lasix.  In mid
[**Month (only) 958**] the patient had an EKG which showed diffuse T wave
inversion.  The patient's enzymes were cycled and he ruled
out for MI.  Shortly thereafter chest x-ray showed congestive
heart failure and patient was diuresed and his respiratory
status improved but echocardiogram at that point showed a
decrease in his EF from 55% in early [**2151-1-29**] to 20-25% in
mid [**2151-2-26**] with multiple wall motion abnormalities in the
left anterior descending artery territory.  On approximately
[**3-24**] to [**3-25**] the patient's blood pressure began to rise again
and was treated with Labetalol, Captopril.  A repeat echo on
[**3-25**] showed an ejection fraction which had increased back to
greater than 50%.  At that point there were still some
residual wall motion abnormalities in the left anterior
descending artery.  The patient was followed by a cardiology
consult service for the remainder of this hospital stay.
They questioned, and it was felt appropriate that the patient
undergo cardiac catheterization for evaluation of anterior
descending artery wall motion abnormalities.  The patient
deferred cardiac catheterization until after his rehab stay.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96121**] at [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation and planning of his
elective catheterization.

Hypertension:  The patient remained with significant
hypertension running systolic pressures in the 150's to 180's
and diastolic pressures in the 70's to 90's throughout the
remainder of the hospital course.  Antihypertensives were
titrated up such that on the day of discharge his
antihypertensive regimen including Labetalol 600 mg po bid,
Isordil 60 mg po tid, Captopril 100 mg po tid, Losartan 100
mg q d, Lasix IV 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] and a Clonidine patch.

3.  Neurology:  The patient was stable with normal mental
status at the time of admission, however, on [**3-15**] mental
status declined and at that point CT of his head was negative
for acute CNS bleed.  One day prior to this the patient had
been in the vascular Intensive Care Unit where he was noted
to have three generalized tonic clonic seizures that were
witnessed by staff on the floor.  MRI and CT showed bilateral
watershed infarct.  At this point the patient was started on
Dilantin and his mental status declined.  He was in a coma
for approximately two weeks but then his mental status
improved.  As of [**3-29**] his mental status was at his baseline
and he remained that way throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient had known effusions at the time
of admission and had an oxygen requirement.  A chest CT done
on [**3-14**] showed a large right lower lobe pulmonary embolism
and the patient was started on Heparin, however, on [**3-17**] he
had hematocrit drops on Heparin so Heparin was discontinued
and inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**3-18**].  The
patient had bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.  Left
sided effusion was tapped on [**3-1**] for one liter of
transudative fluid with symptomatic improvement.  The patient
still had bilateral pleural effusion at the time of discharge
with an oxygen requirement of approximately three liters by
nasal cannula and the plan was to attempt to minimize the
size of the effusion with diuresis.  His oxygen requirement
was stable at the time of discharge.

5.  Hematology:  The patient required multiple transfusions
during the stay.  However, from [**3-29**] to [**4-7**] the patient's
hematocrit was stable in the high 20's requiring only one
unit of packed red cells.  The patient was restarted on
Coumadin for anticoagulation on [**4-2**] and should have his INR
followed at rehab.

6.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had an episode of
pneumonia early in this hospital stay which resolved.
However, the patient did relatively well from an infectious
disease standpoint during this admission.  On [**3-29**] he had a
blood culture positive for coag negative staph, however, this
was taken off the PICC line and blood cultures drawn at that
time were otherwise negative.  The line was pulled.
Surveillance cultures remained negative and the decision was
made not to treat him.  This bacteria was found to be not
coag negative staph but Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.

7.  Renal:  Patient's creatinine was stable throughout this
admission.  He has a history of type 3 membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis with heavy proteinuria.  He was found to
have approximately 21 gm of protein in his urine per day.
The renal consult service followed him and started him on an
angiotensin receptor block and Losartan 100 mg po q d for
treatment of his proteinuria.  At the time of discharge he
was stable with regards to his proteinuria.  He should
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 951**] of renal team.  Ultimately the
plan is to start him on steroids for his proteinuria.

8.  Diet:  Patient is currently on tube feeds as well as oral
feeds.  His oral feeds should be increased as tolerated.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  SMA artery aneurysm status post embolization.
2.  Pulmonary embolism status post IVC filter placement and
Coumadin anticoagulation.
3.  Mild focal wall motion abnormalities in the left anterior
descending artery distribution.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Type III membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol 600 mg po bid, Captopril
100 mg po tid, Losartan 100 mg po q d, Isordil 60 mg po tid,
Clonidine patch .1 mg q 24 hours, Lipitor 10 mg q d, Lasix IV
200 mg [**Hospital1 **].  This will be changed to po calcium carbonate 500
mg [**Hospital1 **], subcu Heparin 5,000 units subcu [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol
Atrovent nebs q 4 hours prn.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good with oxygen requirement of
approximately three liters.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 38**] Rehab facility.

FOLLOW-UP:  With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96121**] of the cardiology service, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of nephrology service and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**] of the
GI service.  The patient will be given phone numbers for
appointments.

Date of Birth:   [**2134-4-24**]     Sex:  M

Service:Neurosurgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 23 year-old high school
teacher had a major seizure in [**2157-6-29**].  He had
fifteen to twenty second spells and was not feeling quite normal
all over his body, dating back to [**Male First Name (un) 1573**] high school and
recurring once or twice per month, but this had not been
[**2157-6-29**].  He was placed on Trileptal and even the
minor spells seemed to have stopped.  His MR scan with
gadolinium showed a 2 by 2 cm left medial temporal lobe
cystic lobulated lesion with enhancing solid components.  The
mass was situated in the amygdala region.  His EEG confirmed
the onset of epileptic activity from the region of the cystic
enhancing lesion.  The decision was made to remove the
decorticography and cortical brain mapping.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He does not use tobacco or alcohol.
He had right knee arthroscopy in [**2153**].  He had anterior
cruciate ligament reconstruction of the right knee in [**2154**].

ALLERGIES:  He had rashes from aspirin and Motrin.  He had
anaphylaxis and rash with Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  He is taking 450 of Trileptal twice a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His vital signs show a blood pressure
of 170/88.  Pulse 86.  Height 5'[**65**]"".  Weight 175 pounds.  His
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat were normal.  His neck was
supple with no adenopathy.  No thyromegaly.  Trachea to
midline.  Chest clear to auscultation and percussion.  His
cardiac examination showed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal
S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  His abdominal examination showed no
organomegaly.  No masses or tenderness.  Normal bowel sounds
to be present.  His neurological examination showed a slight
left facial asymmetry.  Remaining cranial nerves were normal
and his motor examination was normal for strength, tone and
fine movement.  His sensory examination was normal.  His deep
tendon reflexes were 3 out of 4 and symmetric in the upper
and lower extremities.  Single leg stance and tandem walking
were normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  His admission CBC was normal.  His postop
CBC showed an elevated white count, which came down over the
period of three days.  His hematocrit was in the upper 30s
postoperatively.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following admission the patient was taken
to the Operating Room where a left anterior temporal
lobectomy was carried out.  Immediately
postoperatively, he had normal neurological examination
including speech function.  His blood pressure tended to run
in the 150 to 160 range systolically and in the 80 to 90
range diastolically.  He was kept on fluid restriction and
had 4 mg of Decadron given every six hours.  He was continued
on the preoperative Trileptal dose of 450 mg twice a day
after initially treating him overnight with intravenous
Dilantin.  He had increasing naming difficulties over the
second and then third postoperative day and had marked
expressive aphasia by the afternoon on the third postop day.
However, he seemed to be improving by the fourth
postoperative day, but then was having very intermittent
periods of almost normal speech and severe speech deficits
particularly with naming and having problems with
orientation. He was tending to perseverate.  A CT scan showed
no evidence of mass effect from swelling or hemorrhage and an
excellent result of removal of all of the area of tumor.  The
EEG showed some slowing, but showed no evidence of seizure
activity.  However, it was thought that he probably was
having intermittent seizure activity in the area of the
removal and posterior to the removal and so his Trileptal was
increased to 600 mg twice a day.

Following that he had no further problems with increased
speech deficit.  During that time he was also placed back on
intravenous Decadron until the day of his discharge when he
was again placed on oral Decadron.  His incision was free of
drainage.  His temperatures were ranging in the 99 to 100
range.  He was started on Decadron taper only after his
discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ganglioglioma.
2.  Epilepsy secondary to diagnosis one.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Approved.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Discharged to home with follow up
appointments to be arranged.

[**2167-7-13**] Abd Ct : 1. Dilated loops of small bowel with transition
point in a large right abdominal wall hernia is consistent with
small bowel obstruction.
2. Patient is status post ileal conduit urinary diversion and
urostomy,
adjacent to which is a moderate-to-large right-sided abdominal
wall hernia.
3. Locules of gas are seen within the right abdominal wall
hernia, which are concerning for bowel perforation. High-density
fluid within the right
abdominal wall hernia is concerning for leakage of oral
contrast. There is no IV contrast administered to exclude bowel
ischemia. No clear wall is seen around the fluid in the hernia,
although no IV contrast was administered.  Consider repeat with
IV contrast for further delineation.
4. Bilateral hydronephrosis appears increased compared to CT
scan of [**2167-6-3**] but likely not significantly changed from
[**2167-6-13**].
5. Atelectasis and minimal right lower lobe ground-glass opacity
likely
represents volume overload or positioning edema; however, mild
infectious
process cannot be completely excluded.

[**2167-7-18**] Abd CT : 1. Interval development of multifocal
ground-glass peribronchial opacities involving left upper lobe
and the lower lobes, likely represent infection and/or
aspiration. Left predominant abnormality is consistent likely
preferential left lateral decubitus position due to right sided
abscess, and layering fluid within the upper esophagus,
suggesting aspiration.
2. Persistent large rim-enhancing and gas-containing right lower
quadrant
subcutaneous peristomal abscess with significant adjacent
inflammatory
stranding. No evidence for fistula formation. No new abscess.
3. Persistent but decreased bilateral reflux hydronephrosis,
longstanding and likely related to ileal conduit urinary
diversion. Unremarkable right lower quadrant urostomy.
4. Bilateral renal cysts are unchanged.

[**2167-7-21**] CXR : Lung volumes are lower, the small bilateral
pleural effusions are new, but the most important change is
widespread multifocal peribronchial opacification--most likely
widespread infection, perhaps embolic--almost nodular in the
left upper lobe, a new large region of consolidation at both
lung bases, the right anterior and the left posterior.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax.


[**2167-7-26**] Abd CT : 1. Persistence of large rim-enhancing
collection in the right lower quadrant, although the collection
has decreased in size. The collection measures 11.6 cm x 4.6 cm
on the current exam. Given the persistence of the collection in
spite of an indwelling pigtail drainage catheter, the patient
will be transferred to the radiology department for upsizing of
the catheter.
2. Interval improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities, with a
new small
left pleural effusion.
3. Persistent mild left hydronephrosis, likely related to ileal
conduit
urinary diversion.
4. No evidence of bowel obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) 62371**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room, admitted to the hospital and made NPO, hydrated
with IV fluids and placed on IV antibiotics. Plans were made for
drainage of her abdominal abscess in Interventional radiology.
She underwent CT guided drainage on [**2167-7-14**] and after draining
close to 1 liter the drain accidently fell out. She underwent
serial exams thereafter and she gradually became distended.  She
also had multiple episodes of emesis requiring nasogastric tube
placement for decompression.  On [**2167-7-17**] she had some
hypotension and abdominal pain and was transferred to the
Surgical ICU for further management. Her initial wound culture
grew gram negative and gram positive rods and eventual
Lactobacillus.
She was then treated with IV Zosyn, Vancomycin and Flagyl. A CT
showed re accumulation of her abdominal fluid collection and she
had a drain replaced under ultrasound guidance.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she remained NPO and
was hydrated with IV fluids.  Her gastric fluid drainage
diminished and she was passing flatus so her nasogastric tube
was removed.  She gradually tolerated a regular diet without
difficulty.  During this time she developed diarrhea and
specimens for C difficile were sent on 3 different occasions.
In the interim she remained on Flagyl and eventually oral
Vancomycin was added.  Over 3 days the diarrhea gradually
resolved and a C Difficile PCR toxin was sent which was
negative.  Her Flagyl was discontinued but her oral Vancomycin
remains as the plan for antibiotic treatment of her
polymicrobial organisms including lactobacillus will continue
indefinitely until her abscess is totally drained.  The oral
vancomycin will also remain for 2 weeks after the Zosyn has been
discontinued. She has been off of IV Vancomycin since [**2167-7-24**].
She remains afebrile with a normal WBC.

From a pulmonary standpoint she developed a congested cough on
[**2167-7-20**] without fevers but her WBC was 19K. A chest Xray was
done which showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations and she
was already being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.  She
underwent chest PT, incentive spirometry and nebulizer
treatments and within 24 hours had symptomatically improved with
a decreased cough and Room Air saturations of 94-95%.  Of note
she had a urine culture done on [**2167-7-20**] which grew .100K VRE.
The Infectious Disease service has been following her on a daily
basis and felt that she was simply colonized with VRE. They will
continue to follow her in their out patient clinic. See
appointments for details.

Over the last few days she continues to improve with no fevers,
a good appetite and [**11-29**] bowel movements a day. She is up and
walking with assistance and after a long hospitalization she was
discharged to rehab on [**2167-7-28**] with the hope of returning home
after she regains some of her stamina.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F with PMH of DM2 not on insulin, HL, depression and alcohol
abuse presenting with acute renal failure and metabolic disarray
in the setting of recent decreased PO intake and binge drinking.


#. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Likely secondary to
ketoacidosis in the setting of decreased PO intake and alcohol
abuse with a potential small contribution from diabetic
ketoacidosis. Resolved with IV fluid hydration and Insulin
therapy.

#. Pancreatitis - Patient with recent increase in alcohol
intake, now coming with nausea, vomit and lipase of 546. Patient
was initially made NPO, and had her diet slowly advanced. She
was tolerating a regular diet for two days prior to discharge.

#. Acute kidney failure - Initial creatinine of 2.5 from her
baseline of 1. Likely secondary to volume depletion in the
setting of decreased PO intake and vomiting. Resolved with fluid
hydration.

#. Chest pain: Troponin stable at 0.02, 0.04, and 0.04. Chest
pain symptoms more consistent with epigastric pain, thought to
be secondary to alcoholic pancreatitis +/- alcoholic gastritis.

#. Depression: Patient was continued on her home regiment. She
spoke over the phone with her outpatient psychiatrist and plans
to follow-up with her after discharge. The dangers of decreased
PO intake and alcohol were reviewed several times, and patient
was urged to contact a family member, her psychiatrist, or her
PCP if she felt her depression worsening or her appetite
decreasing in the future.

#. Alcohol abuse - Patient with chronic alcohol use and abuse
with last drink on the day of discharge. She showed no signs of
withdrawal throughout her stay.

Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath, recurrent pericardial effusion
found on routine echo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window ([**2102-12-28**])


History of Present Illness:
72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], transferred from
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation and management of recurrent
pericardial effusion and tamponade seen on routine repeat echo.
.
Patient had past admission on [**5-5**]/09 for fatigue, edema,
and decreased exercise tolerance. Found to have pericardial
effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis with removal 300 cc clear
slightly blood-tinged pericardial fluid, with decrease in
pericardial pressure from 26 to 10 mmHg. Patient also underwent
pericardial drain placement. Pericardial fluid culture and
cytology returned negative. Fluid analysis revealed WBC# 6100
(81% PMN), RBC [**Numeric Identifier 83167**] TP 5.1 albumin 2.9 gluc 4 LDH 4230. The
effusion was attributed to RA, but methotrexate was discontinued
(and prednisone increased from 20 to 30 mg daily) in case the
former was contributing.
.
Routine follow-up TTE today at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to
moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with diastolic
right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade. Transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management, where triage V/S 98 125
138/83 18 94%RA. HR 101 without intervention. Labs notable for
INR 3.7, Hct 30.5. EKG showed low voltage in the limb leads. CXR
showed only bibasilar linear atelectasis. Vital signs prior to
transfer 95 132/87 20 97%RA.
.
On the floor, patient is feeling relatively well. Reports having
some shortness of breath, but is at his baseline due to his
COPD. Denies any chest pain, worsening SOB, orthopnea,
palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness.

Echocardiogram ([**2102-12-25**])
FINDINGS:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION:
Limited study,. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal. A small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial
effusion is present with diastolic right ventricular collapse
suggestive of tamponade.
Reffering physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 13109**].

Additional In-house Read:
Small amount of pericardial fluid and no evidence of RV
diastolic collapse.
.
ECHO [**2102-12-30**]
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
body habitus. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal although views are
technically suboptimal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-5-26**],
the pericardial effusion is now smaller.
.
AP Chest [**2102-12-31**]
Study is limited as the lung bases have been excluded from the
field of view. There is again seen some streaky densities at the
bases most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis which is
unchanged. The upper lung fields are clear without focal
consolidation or signs of overt pulmonary edema. Cardiac
silhouette is unchanged, within normal limits.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2102-12-25**] 6:28 PM
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette is normal in
size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary
vascularity is
normal. Linear opacities within both lung bases are compatible
with linear
atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
visualized. No acute skeletal abnormalities are seen.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar linear atelectasis. No acute
cardiopulmonary
abnormality otherwise visualized.
.
CXR [**2103-1-1**]
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases has
improved since
[**12-30**], probably atelectasis. On the left, it is conceivable
that
pneumonia was present and is rapidly clearing, but there is no
new or
worsening consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
effusion or
mediastinal widening. Heart size is normal

Brief Hospital Course:
72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], presents with
recurrent pericardial effusion concerning of tamponade and
complaints of some progressive shortness of breath.

#. Pericardial effusion - patient has had history of pericardial
effusion in the past, thought to be a complicaton of RA. Had a
pericardiocentesis with drain placement in 5/[**2101**]. Initially had
methotrexate discontinued for concerns of worsening pericardial
effusion, but was restarted back on it in [**Month (only) 205**] when patient did
not tolerate Humira well. Patient has been receiving regular
follow up with his cardiologist with a repeat echo every 6
weeks.  His echo read done at [**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate
mainly anterior pericardial effusion with evidence of diastolic
right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.  An
additional read done by cardiology service here showed small
amount of fluid with no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.  He
was hemodynamically stable during his admission and breathing
was not labored, although reported to be slightly worse over the
last few weeks.  Pulsus was checked twice a day and remained
consistently around 7-8mmHg.  Methotrexate was held given the
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.  Patient was evaluated by
thoracic surgery for pericardial window.  Procedure was
performed on [**2102-12-28**] with drainage of only 80cc of fluid and
was complicated by afib with RVR.
The drainage tube was subsequently removed and he is being
followed with serial imaging which at the time of discharge
showed a smaller pericardial effusion on echo and only
atelectasis on CXR. Fluid culture was positive for
propionobacterium acnes which was felt to be a contaminant.
Biopsy from pericardial window showed unremarkable cartilage and
skeletal muscle and fragments of pericardium with chronic
inflammation and fibrin deposition.
.
#. A fib - patient takes warfarin at home, was found to be
supratherapeutic at INR of 3.7 on admission. INR was reversed
for the pericardial window. He was bridged on heparin drip to
coumadin and the coumadin alone was continued once his INR was
therapeutic.
.
#. HTN - patient was continued on home dosage of metoprolol,
furosemide, and spironolactone during admission.  Valsartan was
substituted for his home dose of olmesartan during admission,
but patient was switched back to olmesartan on discharge.
.
# Anemia: he was found to have a microcytic anemia consistent
with anemia of chronic disease. An outpatient colonoscopy can be
considered as an outpatient.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - patient was continued on home regimen of
pravastatin
.
#. Rheumatoid Arthritis - patient's home regimen of methotrexate
was held for pericardial effusion.  Was restarted on discharge
after his pericardial window procedure.
.
#. COPD - currently at baseline, patient was in no respiratory
distress.  During admission he was maintained on home dose of
spiriva.  Advair was substituted for symbicort while admitted,
but patient was restarted on symbicort on discharge.
.
#. DM - patient was continued on his home regimen of insulin as
well as regular insulin sliding scale.
.
#. GERD - patient was continued on omeprazole
.
#. Glaucoma - patient was continued on prednisolone drop to left
eye and artificial tears

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with h/o PUD which was c/b gastric outlet obstruction
s/p vagotomy, antrectomy and bilroth II repair [**4-22**] c/b jejunal
stump leak and recurrent liver abscesses s/p drainage and
fistula creation, polymicrobial BSI s/p treatment course of
daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole (finished course of IV abx on
[**2129-11-17**]) presenting with worsening abdominal pain. Patient has
had an extensive medical course since surgery in [**4-22**] including
multiple hospitalizations and rehab stays and was on IV abx
until [**2129-11-17**]. She was living in an ECF ([**Month/Day/Year 5682**]) until around
when abx were discontinued and went home to live with her
husband. She was doing okay at home, with increasing PO intake
and a stable level of pain and nausea however over the last few
days, her pain has worsened. Per family, on Tuesday last week
patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital after a fall. Patient
doesn't remember the fall, but she had just taken several pain
medications (incl dilaudid, which she takes every 4 hours 4 mg
without fail) and per her daughter and husband she often gets
confused after taking her medications. She had a workup at
[**Hospital **] hospital which showed no fractures or other process, and
was discharged within a few hours to [**Hospital 5682**] ECF again.
.
Over the last few days at [**Hospital 5682**], paitent has complained of
worsening pain and stable nausea. Denies any vomiting,
constipation, cough, fevers, chills, or other symptoms. She
presented today for worsening pain despite her pain medications.
Pain is stabbing in nature associated with nausea. Also thinks
that her fistual output may be increasing.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.8 100 111/60 24 94% ra. ED exam
with diffuse ttp mainly over the RUQ/RLQ. Ostomy site with green
cloudy fluid. Labs notable for WBC 26.1, Hct 27.7 (at baseline),
ALT 131, AST 51, Na 132, HCO3 19, alk phos 1452. CT abd/pelvis
with Left lower lobe opacification compatible with pneumonia,
decreased mid abdominal collection. She received dilaudid 1 mg
IV x 2, zofran as well as IV ativan. Surgery consulted in ED,
recommended CT abd with contrast, CT abd was done which showed
abscesses largely unchanged but LLL PNA. Surgery recommended no
intervention now, admit to medicine for IV abx for PNA with
surgery following. Pt was given dose of vanco/zosyn for HCAP.
.
Currently, patient complains of [**4-21**] pain, much imprved from
when she came in, howver she is not oriented to place or year
having just received IV ativan and dilaudid. Per daughter who
gave most history, patient veyr often gets like this after
receiving pain or anxiety medications.

.
Per Opt ID note:
Subsequent course after initial surgery was complicated by
polymicrobial BSI (Enterobacter cloacae, VRE, MRSA, Clostridium)
and hepatic abscess requiring drainage on [**6-1**] (Enterobacter,
Enterococcus) s/p drain removal and prolonged course of
antibiotic therapy (daptomycin, ertapenem) ending [**7-6**].
.
She was re-admitted on [**7-15**] with a recurrent fluid collection.
Treatment with daptomycin and meropenem was re-initiated.  She
underwent CT guided drainage of that major collection and
cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans and [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], VRE.  Micafungin
was added to her antibiotic regimen.
.
In the setting of a persistent leukocytosis, she was found to
have a new liver abscess on [**7-30**] and underwent CT guided
drainage with fluid growing VRE, MRSA and yeast. On [**7-28**], her
antibiotics were simplifed to tigecycline, micafungin.  however
due to abdominal cramping which may have been in part related to
tigecycline, her regimen was changed to daptomycin, ertapenem,
and fluconazole on [**2129-8-11**].
.
On [**8-17**] she was readmitted to the hospital for elevation of LFTs
and increasing abdominal pain. CT of the abdomen on [**8-17**] showed
an increased fluid collection in the caudate lobe of the liver
measuring 2.1x2.3cm. Patient had CT guided drainage of the fluid
collection on [**8-19**] and culture results grew Klebsiella pneumoniae
that was pansensitive. Patient was maintained on Daptomycin and
Fluconazole however Ertapenem was changed to Meropenem on [**8-18**].
Decision was made to maintain the patient on Meropenem on
discharge instead of ertapenem for coverage of Enterbacter which
grew previously as she seemed to have improvement in her
abdominal pain, transaminitis, and remained afebrile with
Meropenem. Dosing was changed from q6h to q8h to help ease
administration of the medicine.
.
Antibiotic course:
[**Date range (1) 90350**] Daptomycin, Ertapenem
[**Date range (1) 3047**] Daptomycin
[**Date range (1) 90351**] Linezolid
[**Date range (1) 90352**] Meropenem
[**Date range (1) 29023**] Tigecycline (switched due to abd cramping)
[**Date range (1) 90353**] Micafungin
[**8-11**] abx changed to Daptomycin, Ertapenem, and Fluconazole on
discharge
[**8-18**] Daptomycin and Fluconazole continued from previous discharge
and Ertapenem changed to Meropenem
.
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**11-1**] which showed some minimal
improvement in previously seen fluid collections near the liver
though a new 2cm fluid collection was found in between the loops
of the jejunum (not amenable to percutaneous drainage).  On
[**11-17**], she was taken off Daptomycin, Meropenem.  An was started
on Bactrim DS 1 tab po BID and continue Fluconazole 400mg po
daily.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2129-12-11**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2129-12-5**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia. In
addition,
stable areas of right nodular opacification since [**2129-11-1**].
2. Interval decrease in mid abdominal collections in the region
of prior
surgery at the duodenal stump with no new fluid collections
identified;
however, a few small bubbles of gas remain with the shrunken
residual
collection.
3. Stable appearance of enterocutaneous fistula within the right
mid
abdominal wall.
4. Stable appearance of intrahepatic biliary dilation.
Correlation with
laboratory data and other clinical factors is recommended;
sequelae of a
stricture or even potentially a stone is possible despite the
lack of change. A small calcified gallstone on the prior study
is now absent and may have passed in the interim.
5. Stable appearance of markedly narrowed main portal vein and
attenuation of the left portal vein which is probably occluded
with collateral flow.
Persistent areas of differential enhancement of the liver may
accordingly be related to different flow patterns although it is
difficult to exclude
cholangitis.

[**2129-12-5**] LIVER & GALLBLADDER US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Turbulent flow in the proximal portion of the main portal
vein consistent with severe narrowing as seen on the preceding
CT.
2. The left portal vein could not be visualized, which could be
related to
thrombosis, as seen on the CT.
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation consistent with
postinflammatory stricture as noted previously. Gall bladder
wall thickening appears to relate to this contiguous
scarring/inflammatory change.

[**2129-12-10**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Improved, but still present left lower lobe
infiltrate.

[**2129-12-15**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post Billroth 2 with partial small bowel obstruction
of the efferent limb of the gastrojejunostomy, with marked
upstream dilatation of the jejunal limb continguous with the
duodenal stump, and moderate gastric distention.
2. Increase in extraluminal gas in right upper quadrant
including along the border of the left lobe of the liver, near
the oversewn duodenal stump and proximal jejunum, and at the
base of the enterocutaneous fistula. Compared to [**2129-12-5**], there
is a new 2.9 x 1.3 cm rim enhancing aortocaval fluid collection
near liver hilum.
3. Stable intrahepatic biliary dilatation and left chronic
portal vein
occlusion with cavernous transformation.
5. Persistent bibsilar pneumonia, improved on the left but
worsened on the
right.

[**2129-12-16**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm with an atrial premature beat. Baseline artifact.
Since the
previous tracing ventricular premature beat is not seen. Atrial
premature beat is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo F with h/o PUD which was c/b gastric outlet obstruction
s/p vagotomy, antrectomy and Billroth II repair [**4-22**] c/b jejunal
stump leak and recurrent liver abscesses s/p drainage and
fistula creation, polymicrobial BSI s/p treatment course of
daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole (finished course of IV abx on
[**2129-11-17**]) presenting with acute onset sharp abdominal pain, LLL
infiltrate on CXR and CT and unchanged abdominal collections
.
# Transaminitis: This is likely related to hepatic abscesses
which appear stable on CT scan vs hepatic vein thrombosis,
although is on Coumadin.  US and CT abdomen largely unchanged
from prior.  She was placed on linezolid and meropenem.  She
underwent ERCP on 10/27th and was hold off Coumadin prior to her
going over for ERCP.  After she returned, heparin gtt was
started with bridge to warfarin.  INR goal is [**3-17**]. She became
supratherapeutic and her Coumadin was held until her INR
normalized. LFTs improved prior discharge. INR was 1.7. The
patient was send home with [**Month/Day (3) 269**] to continue INR monitoring.
.
# LLL pneumonia/leukocytosis: Most likely related to PNA despite
lack of symptoms from PNA or cough. Patient does have
leukocytosis however to 26, with elevated alk phos and
transaminitis.  Imaging does not support intra-abdominal
process, but given extensive history, still a concern. The
patient has UTI with  ENTEROCOCCUS SP., blood cultures x 2 and
stool were negative. Knowing her history with multiple drug
resistant organisms in blood stream infections, including VRE,
Enterobacter resistant to pip/tazo (from [**2129-5-31**]), she was
changed to IV linezolid/meropenem. ID was consulted and their
recommendations were followed. The patient underwent empirical
treatment with IV Linezolid, Meropenem and Fluconazole, after
completion of the course, she was restarted on her home
antibiotic coverage with Bactrim DS and PO Fluconazole. Repeat
urine cultures were negative. She will continue to follow up
with ID as outpatient. On discharge, patient still has mild
leukocytosis, was afebrile with stable vital signs.
.
#SBO: Abdominal pain: worse in the last few days, abdominal pain
can be associated with PNA. CT abd doesn't appear to be changed
from prior, nausea is stable, no diarrhea or vomiting. Repeat CT
scan on [**2129-12-15**] demonstrated partial bowel obstruction. The
patient was made NPO with NGT, IVF and nutritional service was
called for TPN recommendations. PICC line was placed and TPN was
started on [**2129-12-17**]. On [**12-18**], NGT was removed, and diet was
advanced on [**12-19**], which were well tolerated. Diet was advanced
to regular on [**12-21**], and TPN was discontinued. Patient tolerated
regular diet well with good appetite and adequate oral intake.
.
#Anemia of chronic disease: The patient has a history of anemia
with Hct ~ 25. On [**2129-12-15**] Hct was 22.1 and patient received one
unit of RBC. After transfusion, Hct improved to baseline and was
24.0 prior discharge. Patient's PCP will continue to monitor her
Hct as outpatient.
.
#Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and
takes Soma, Dilaudid and Hyoscyamine. Fentanyl patch was added
to achieve better pain control per Chronic Pain Service. The
patient was discharged home with instruction to taper down her
Fentanyl patch within 3 weeks. [**Date Range 269**] instructed to monitor
patient's pain and will contact [**Name (NI) **] Surgery Service at [**Hospital1 18**]
with any questions or concerns.
.
At the time of discharge on [**2129-12-22**], the patient was doing
well, afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without
assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient was
discharged home with services and home PT. The patient received
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

.
Coumadin (Warfarin):
What is this medicine used for?
This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not
form.
How does it work?
Warfarin changes the body's clotting system. It thins the blood
to prevent clots from forming.
What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing;
chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color;
fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe
dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you
hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel
fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically,
severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black,
tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds,
coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding,
severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.
Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for
whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems,
vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems
could affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.
Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet:
Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin.
For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat
while taking this medication.
Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid
foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of
vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However,
recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K
from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your
dietary vitamin K intake.

These foods contain vitamin K:
Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli,
Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower,
Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens,
Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver.
Other: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins,
Soybeans and Cashews.
Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage
but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious
problems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you
drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual
pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on
special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually
would on any regular day of the week.
Monitoring:
The doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by
testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is
clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for
bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for
forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood
test that is right for you ([**3-17**]). The blood test used for
monitoring is called an INR.
Use of Other medications:
When Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can
change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also
change the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to
talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you
are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics,
vitamins, or herbal products.
The [**Month/Day (3) 269**] will check you blood for Coumadin level. They will send
results to your PCP (Dr. [**Name (NI) 70277**]) and he will continue to
adjust your Coumadin intake.
.
Please continue to taper down your Fentanyl patch as prescribed.

Brief Hospital Course:
70-yo man w/ HTN, HL, LBP s/p L4-S1 decompression / fusion, w/
post-op course was complicated by delirium as well as an event
of hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Hypotension and
tachycardia resolved, hypoxia and delerium were persistent for
several days. Ultimately Pt delerium resolved with conservative
management and improvement of O2 status. He required transfer to
the MICU service on [**9-16**]. During that time they felt his hypoxia
- Concern for PE given timing w/ significant HD compromise
including hypotension and tachycardia, both of which have now
resolved. CT was negative for major pe but could not rule out
small subsegmental PEs. Lungs clear on exam and CXR clear. Pt
may have aspirated in setting of altered mental status although
CXR unchanged. ABG c/w hypoxia as well. Of note patient sounds
stridorous moving adequate air and is oxygenating ok. Sleep
consult feels that he most likely has OSA but in setting of
delirium would be hard to ascertain whether it is contributing
to his hypoxia. At this time he is oxygenating well on room air.

.
His delirium - Post-op delirium. Was thought likely [**2-27**] EtOH
withdrawal but actually became clearer when benzos were held.
?paradoxical effect to benzodiazepines in the elderly. Also was
much clearer after morphine and when he was clear during his
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS o/n he did complain of back pain.
Ultimately improved with better O2 status and conservative
management.

His motor strength in his legs remained full. With normal
sensation except left inner thigh. He had developed significant
bruising around his left flank area that resoloved by the time
he was discharged. He was tolerating a regular diet and voiding
without difficulty. He was cleared by PT to go home with
supervision which his family can provide.

History of Present Illness:
42 year old male with history of asthma, hypertension,
macrocytic anemia, DVT/PE in [**2108**] and erosive gastritis who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] with alcoholic pancreatitis and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute respiratory failure and shock.

Briefly, the patient increased alcohol consumption recently to
[**12-4**]+ pints daily in the setting of becoming unemployed ([**Month (only) 956**]
[**2112**]). Reportedly he had consumed no alcohol for ~ four days
prior to admission to OSH [**2113-12-13**] for abdominal pain. The
abdominal pain occurred ~9:30am on [**2113-12-13**] after he had a
light breakfast (half a bagel). He described the pain as
epigastric and tight band-like, with associated nausea, no
vomiting. +chills, no fevers or sweats.

He received 8 liters of volume resuscitation on the medicine
floor but became hypotensive to SBP60s on [**2113-12-14**] and was
transferred to the ICU where he was resuscitatied with 10-12
more liters but required norepinephrine to maintain his blood
pressures. His creatinine rose to 2.9 (from 1.0), his calcium
dropped to 4s, his magnesium also dropped to 1.2. CT
abdomen/pelvis (without contrast) showed severe pancreatitis but
no evidence of other complications. Because of his history of
prior DVT/PE and his hemodynamic instability, LENIs were
performed showing a DVT in his right popliteal fossa and the
patient was started on heparin gtt (at 1500 units). As his
abdomen became more distended, the patient developed respiratory
distress and was intubated ~ midnight [**2113-12-15**], sedated with
fentanyl (150mcg) and propofol (70mcg) and his norepi was
increased (0.9mcg). He was started on bicarb gtt for metabolic
acidosis and renal failure. Overnight [**2113-12-15**] from midnight to
7am, the patient was oliguric (130cc) and CXR showed low lung
volumes, atelectasis. His labs were notable for Na 121, K 5.9,
Cr 5.0, calcium 3.2, magnesium 1.8, CK 8565 and albumin 1.6. He
was treated for his hyperkalemia with IV bicarb gtt (100cc/hr),
10 grams IV calcium gluconate, insulin gtt (12 units, for blood
sugars 300s). Left IJ and arterial line placed prior to
transfer. The patient was started on Vasopressin en route (0.4)
and Vent settings were AC18, PS 22, PEEP 10, FiO2 60%.

On arrival to the ICU, inital vitals were, T: 97.2 BP: 68/39 P:
113 R: 12 O2: 100% on AC (PMV). The patient's norepi and
vasopressin were increased and phenylephrine was started, in
addition to fluid boluses. Bladder pressure was 25.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 yo M w/ PMH of asthma, HTN, macrocytic anemia, PE/DVT,
erosive gastritis, alcoholism, and prior bouts of
alcohol-induced pancreatitis requiring ICU stay in [**2108**],
transferred from OSH for shock, likely secondary to severe
pancreatitis.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Shock: Distributive and hypovolemic shock in the setting of
severe pancreatitis, resulting in respiratory failure, renal
failure, and pressor-dependence. Had questioned possible
cardiogenic component, given possibility of PE with known DVT,
however echo did not show signs of right heart strain and EF
normal.  On admission, started on triple pressors with
norepinephrine, vasopressin, and neosynephrine, but he was
quickly weaned off the neosynephrine.  He was aggressively
volume resuscitated, getting almost 20L of fluid within the
first day of arrival. Lactates normalized.  Able to
intermittently wean down pressors as he appeared to stabilize
after 3-4 days. His pressures improved with fluid removal w/
CVVH. Pt remained on low-dose norepi w/ CVVH until decision was
made to move towards comfort measures due after discussion with
family.

# Acute respiratory failure: Due to combination of shock with
aggressive volume resuscitation, ARDS, and extra-thoracic
pressure from abdominal distension.  PE thought to be unlikely
given normal echo, but could not obtain CTA given renal failure.
 Questioned possible pneumonia on admission-- sputum at OSH grew
moraxella and haemophilus at OSH and had positive gram stains
here at [**Hospital1 **], however never cultured any organisms from sputum
since his arrival at [**Hospital1 **].  Pt completed empiric 8 day treatment
for HAP/HCAP with Vancomycin/Zosyn/levofloxacin (finished [**12-20**]).  Started on ARDSnet protocol, paralyzed initially for more
effective ventilation.  Put on APRV for further recruitment and
increased oxygenation.  Weaned off paralytics.  Had numerous
episodes of spontaneous desaturations with movements from mucous
plugging, bronched on [**12-21**] with removal of thick mucous plugs.
Then able to start weaning down APRV settings, down to CMV. Pt
had a repeat bronchoscopy to try to remove excess mucus on [**12-29**]. Given his continued illness, Pt had a tracheostomy placed on
[**1-1**] by interventional pulmonology.

# Acute renal failure: Developed at the OSH, Cr 4.5 on transfer.
 Etiology likely ATN in the setting of shock and severe
hypovolemia.  Renal consulted, felt that CVVH would be
preferable to HD, given his severe acidosis on admission and his
hemodynamic instability.  Dialysis catheter placed [**12-16**] and
intiated CRRT that day.  Unfortunately experienced numerous
complications with his CRRT, including malfunctioning catheter
(requiring replacement [**12-20**]) and multiple episodes of clotting
in the filters.

# Fever, leukocytosis:  Course complicated by repeated fevers
and leukocytosis.  Most likely due to continuing pancreatitic
inflammation, perhaps formation of abscess/necrosis. Pt had a
very thorough workup for possible infectious etiology of his
fevers including multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, stool
cultures and C diff antigens, and sputum cultures. Pt was
treated for HAP/HCAP with Vancomycin/Zosyn/levofloxacin for 8
days. His chest x-ray continued to improve. He never grew any
signficant organisms from his urine culture, and he had several
c diff stool toxin tests which were all negative. Infectious
disease was consulted, which showed

# Pancreatitis: Likely [**1-4**] alcoholism.  OSH CT abdomen showed no
pseudocysts or necrotizing tissue but was limited by having no
IV contrast, impressive stranding seen however which may
organize in the next several days.   RUQ US did not show CBD
dilatation or stone.  Not continued on heparin despite DVT to
avoid causing pancreatic hemorrhage.  Triglycerides and lipase
trended down.  Repeat CT abdomen obtained on [**12-21**] due to rising
fevers and WBC count, showed increasing pancreatic inflammation
but no evidence of pseudocyst or drainable collection.

# Metabolic acidosis:  pH 7.03 initially on presentation, likely
from elevated lactate, sepsis, renal failure.  pH improved with
initiation of dialysis and increased ventilation of vent.

# Anemia: Likely multifactorial ?????? normocytic with low
reticulocyte index suggests ongoing alcohol abuse, chronic
illness. Also hemedilution with volume resuscitation. Low grade
GI bleed likely given guaiac positive from NG and flexiseal.
Heme looked at smear, no evidence of hemolysis.

# Thrombocytopenia: Likely splenic sequestration from alcoholic
liver disease and hemodilution.  Initially had concern for HIT,
however timing is not quite right.  HIT antibody sent anyway,
came back negative.  Heme evaluated, thought vanc/zosyn may
cause thrombocytopenia, no DIC, few spherocytes but no schistos
on smear. Lots of bands w/ toxic granulation consistent w/
sepsis.

# Increased bladder pressure:  Stable, in mid 20s, 29 right now.
KUB suggests ascites; the patient likely third spacing fluid
into his abdomen and also likely has liver cirrhosis,
malnutrition (low albumin).  Concerning for developing abdominal
compartment syndrome. Bladder pressure constant at 24. UOP 5
over the last day.

# Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Given
aggressive volume resuscitation, IVF boluses with normal saline
as respiratory status tolerates. Trend electrolytes q4 hours

# Alcohol abuse: Per the patient, had not had alcohol X 4 days
prior to admission. Does have history of DTs and difficult to
manage last admission for pancreatitis at [**Hospital1 18**] (in [**2108**])

# Transaminitis:  Stable, trending down

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: After an extensive workup in the ED, she had
activity that appeared to be a seizure, and was started on
dilantin.  She was extensively hydrated, and her hypernatremia
was corrected from 162 to 140 over the next two days.  She was
noted to be in acute renal failure, thought to be due to an
ATN-type picture.  She was also found to be hypothyroid and an
initial echo showed an EF of <10% with global LV akinesis.  She
required pressor support for her hypotension and remained
intubated for breathing support.  Her MICU course by systems is
as follows:

CV: Elevated CKs on admission but no evidence of MI from
troponins or EKG changes.  Echo on [**2188-4-14**] showed LV dysfunction
as noted above, noting EF<10% as well as 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Also
noted at that time to have a large LV thrombus as well as LAA
thrombus, for which she was started on IV heparin.  Over the
course of her MICU stay her hypotension resolved and gradually
she developed mild hypertension, for which she was started on
isordil and nifedipine.  Repeat echo performed [**2188-4-25**] shows
global LV dysfunction but improvement in LVEF to 20-25%, with
left thrombi still visible.  Her PTT has been maintained in the
55-75 range and she was started on coumadin today.  Cardiology
has been following closely.  Her hypothermia resolved with
passive warming on admission, although she has had several
episodes of mild hypothermia off and on over her hospital stay
which has resolved with blankets and monitoring.

Neuro: Seizure activity last noted on [**4-22**], EEG performed
[**2188-4-18**] which showed global slowing without focal abnormalities
indicative of a diffuse metabolic, toxic, or infectious process.
 Was switched to Keppra on [**4-22**].  Neurological exams have been
non-focal to date, with a gradual improvement in mental status
over the course of her MICU stay. At the time of discharge, she
is awake and talking but not completely oriented and very
lethargic, but this is vast improvement over initial
assessments.  She has had an extensive head and neck workup upon
admission which has been largely negative save for evidence of
old lacunar infarcts.  Neuro has been following closely.  As her
mental status improved, it became apparent that the patient
suffered from cortical blindness with associated neglect of her
deficit; MRI exam failed to demonstrate discrete lesions
affecting her visual pathways.

Renal:	Acute renal failure with low urine output on admission
and was started on CVVH [**4-13**] and switched to hemodialysis on
[**4-17**] for which she had a tunneled RIJ catheter placed. Urine
protein to creatinine ratios since [**4-14**] have been consistently
higher than 3.0, indicative of a probable nephrotic syndrome,
but U/A microscopy showed only scant muddy-brown casts. At the
time of discharge, she had increased urine output and was
started on an oral diuretic regimen. She did not require
hemodialysis for 4-5 days prior to discharge and her creatinine
remained stable.

Endocrine: long-standing NIDDM with unknown complications, and
has required NPH and sliding scale insulin during the MICU
admission.  Hypothyroidism initially treated with levothyroxine
and IV T3, which has improved her lab values, and the IV T3 was
stopped on [**4-24**], and she has remained on the levothyroxine.
Considerable thought has been given to the idea that this
clinical picture may be one of myxedemic coma, and endocrine has
been following as well, but is not convinced this is the case.
She was also noted to have low cortisol response on admission
and was started on IV steroids, has since been tapered down and
is currently on a prednisone taper which was completed by the
time of discharge.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 54741**] was markedly thrombocytopenic on admission with
platelets around 30K, but this remained somewhat stable and has
improved with platelet transfusions (3 total, most recently on
[**2188-4-23**]).  Her hematocrit on admission was low (21.7) and she
has received a total of 6 units RBCs since admission (most
recently 2 units on [**4-21**]).  The heme service was constuled and
felt that there was no evidence of ongoing hemolysis but that
her iron studies show some indication of a possible chronic
anemia unrelated to her iron levels, and a continually low
reticulocyte count. If there are any future concerns, she should
follow up with hematology.

Pulmonary: Pt was intubated on admission and remained intubated
until [**4-24**].  During that time she was initially clear on CXR but
developed bilateral layered effusions bilaterally (R>L) and a
focal  ground glass opacity in the LUL.  The effusion is thought
to be evidence of CHF, infection, or aspiration.  The patient
was started on a week course of Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and
Levofloxacin shortly after admission, and finished her course on
[**4-19**], with no evidence of infection since.   Serial CXRs have
shown a gradual increase in size of the pleural effusions with
atelectasis and collapse of the lower lungs. These effusions
were felt to be secondary to heart failure and improved with
diuresis.

F/E/N:	As noted the hypernatremia corrected over the first few
days and her other electrolytes have remained reasonably stable
with hemodialysis.  She has a NGT placed and is currently
receiving her enteral nutrition through this.  She has been
noted to have increasing edema, thought to be secondary to her
poor renal output, which have been increasing somewhat lately.
The patient was seen by Speech and swallow and deemed safe for
oral intake in a monitored setting.

GU: Treated for  a yeast infection

CODE:	PATIENT IS DNR/DNI

DISPO:	transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

No history of congestive heart failure per the patient.
Recently, he stopped his diuretics.

Serial echocardiograms have shown increasing severity of
aortic stenosis.  He was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] in [**2140-1-13**] for a cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Morbid obesity.
4.  Tobacco use.
5.  Venous stasis ulcers.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post left cataract surgery.
2.  Status post tonsillectomy.
3.  Status post varicocele surgery.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 40 mg q. day.
2.  Spironolactone 25 mg q. day versus twice a day.

ALLERGIES:   Norvasc, which causes increasing lower extremity
edema.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Tobacco use is remote; discontinued 40
years ago.  Positive ETOH use; decreased per report by wife
over the last four years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Height is 5'[**47**]""; weight 310 pounds.

respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 99% on room air.  In
general, an obese man with severely draining venous stasis
ulcers in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric, noninjected.
Extraocular movements intact.  Neck is supple with no jugular
venous distention, no lymphadenopathy and no bruits.
Oropharynx is clear.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and
rhythm with a III/VI perisystolic murmur at the left sternal
border.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is
soft, obese, nontender.  Bilateral tinea of the groins.
Extremities with bilateral venous stasis changes to just
below the knees.  Ulcers with clear to green drainage on the
lateral right and medial left.  Pulses:  Carotids two plus
bilaterally, radial two plus bilaterally, femoral - left is
the catheterization site; the right is two plus.  Popliteal
two plus bilaterally dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial,
both two plus bilaterally.  Neurological:  Motor and sensory
is grossly intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly
intact.

LABORATORY:  Data is white blood cell count 9.3, hematocrit
33.9, platelets 288.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.7, chloride
100, carbon dioxide 30, BUN 23, creatinine 1.1.  INR was 1.3.

EKG was sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy,
nonspecific ST-T wave changes in leads 5 and 6.

Echocardiogram with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy,
severely dilated left atrium with an ejection fraction of
75%.  Mild resting LVOT obstruction.

Catheterization showed 50% left main, 20% ostial right
coronary artery, 40% diagonal, aortic valve area 1.3
centimeters squared.

The patient was discharged to home following his
catheterization for further treatment of his venous stasis
ulcers and an appointment with Vascular Surgery for follow-up
regarding lower extremity ulcers.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He returned on [**2-23**] where he was
admitted directly to the Operating Room.  At that time, he
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #23 tissue valve
and coronary artery bypass graft times one with the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending.
Please see the Operating Room report for full details.

The patient tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient had a heart rate
of 91.  He was a-paced with a mean arterial pressure of 65
and a central venous pressure of 10.  He had Levophed at 0.12
mics per kg per minute and Propofol at 20 mics per kg per
minute.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient
experienced a labile blood pressure.  A transesophageal
echocardiogram was performed at the bedside which showed some
systolic anterior motion.  His Levophed and Neo-Synephrine
were weaned to off and he was given volume.  The patient did
well hemodynamically following these maneuvers.

Then, his anesthesia was reversed.  He was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the night of his surgery
and on postoperative day one

Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable on the left but
increased on the right following some improvement in transient
interstitial pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly with particular left
atrial enlargement is longstanding. Tip of the tracheostomy tube
abuts the lateral wall of the trachea and should be evaluated
clinically. Tip of the left PIC line projects over the margin of

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a a 63yo M s/p OLT ([**5-11**]) for HepC cirrhosis/HCC on
immunosuppression, s/p tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis
([**7-11**]), recurrent pna admitted from [**Hospital3 **] rehab
for increasing dyspnea x 1 month, found to have multiple
pulmonary nodules but no PE seen on CTA.  These nodules were not
previously seen (last CT chest at [**Hospital1 18**] [**4-11**]). Of note, recently
d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-1-22**] for pneumonia, empirically treated
with vanc/ceftaz for unclear duration.
.
## Respiratory Failure - On this admission, patient was
re-started on vanco, ceftaz, and levo for nosocomial PNA.
Infectious disease was consulted for possible
infectious/inflammatory etiology.  Urine legionella, CMV, serum
cryptococcal antigen, and 3 AFB smears were negative. Bronch was
attempted by IP on [**2-15**] but was unsuccessful due to small trach.
 Thoracics were consulted for VATS, and the patient underwent
VATS with BAL and wedge biopsies of right lower lobe and middle
lobes on [**2-18**].  Chest tubes placed to suction postoperatively.
[**Name (NI) 4452**], pt received 1 mg midazolam and intraoperatively 340 mg
Propofol, 125 mcg Fentanyl, 12 mg Vecuronium.  Also received 14
mg of morphine (last given at 10:45 pm), Ceftaz, Vancomycin,
Hydrocort 100 mg IV, Neostigmine, and glycopyrrolate.  EBL was
50 cc and intraoperatively, received 300 cc LR.  In OR, pt had
ABG of 7.30/68/125.  [**Name (NI) **], pt initially placed on
100% trach mask and sent to PACU.  Follow up ABG was 7.08/94/154
and pt was somnolent.  He was briefly placed on CMV for 30
minutes then CPAP PS 10/5.  Repeat ABG was 7.10/71/104.  He was
transferred to ICU for further ventilatory management.
.
     Patient likely developed acute on chronic respiratory
acidosis.  The acute respiratory acidosis was thought to be
secondary to narcotics/sedatives causing hypoventilation as well
as exposure to 100% FIO2 leading to decreased respiratory drive
and causing more shunt lung physiology given his chronic
obstructive lung disease and Pickwickian syndrome. He was
initially placed on ventilator and then eventually weaned off to
trach mask. He required very frequent pulmonary toileting due to
copious amount of sputum production which was thought to be
secondary to his pulmonary nodules vs infection. The pathology
result of the pulmonary nodule biopsy returned as bronchiolitis
obliteran pneumonitis. Liver transplant consultants thought that
Sirolimus was likely the culprit for the cause of BOOP and
discontinued sirolimus on [**2-21**] and increased Cellcept to 1000mg
[**Hospital1 **] and continued prenisone 5mg daily.  They did not feel
necessary to start high dose prednisone for BOOP and felt that
pt would recover with discontinuation of sirolimus. In addition,
BAL and tissue culture from the VATS came back positive for
pseudomonas, GNR, and Coag positive Staph.  These organisms
could very well have been colonized however after discussion
with ID, patient was continued on vanco and ceftaz to finish a
10 day course on [**2160-2-23**].  The chest tube was placed during VATS
procedure was managed by thoracis and initially planeed on
removing the chest tube on [**2160-2-23**] or [**2160-2-24**].   Patient was
tolerating trach mask ok and was transferred to the medical
floor.  On the floor he was continued on ceftaz/vanco for 10
days as above.  FK506 was started on [**2-24**] and increased cellcept
to 1 gm [**Hospital1 **]. He continued to have copious yellow/white thick
secretioning requiring suctioning every few hrs initially.
Chest tubes were discontinued on [**2-26**].  Chest CT was done on
[**2-28**].  On AM [**2-27**] patient was noted to be more lethargic.  He
was also requiring frequent suctioning, nebs.  ABG was near his
baseline however given nursing concern he was transferred back
to Medical ICU.  He was placed on CPAP/PS briefly and tolerated
well and was changed over to trach mask.  Plan is for trach
collar during the day and BIPAP 8/5 at night.
.
# Renal Insufficienty - Post operatively patient was noted to be
in oliguric renal failure.  REnal was consulted.  He had acute
on chronic renal insufficiency.  Urine lytes were sent were
consistent with pre-renal vs. ATN.  The creatinine and urine
output improved with aggressive IV fluids.
.
#  OLT - Liver followed the patient in the unit and discontinued
sirolimus and increased Cellcept as above. Tacrolimus started
[**2160-2-26**] along with mycophenolate, and prednisone.  Continue
Tacrolimus 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#  DM II - Glucose control maintained with Sliding scale
insulin.
.
#  Anemia - Microcytic. Hct stable during this admission.
Hyperplastic polyp on [**7-10**] colonoscopy. Received 1U PRBC on
[**2-25**].  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease, iron
normal.   Epogen was continued.
.
#  Hypertension - Continued on metoprolol and amlodipine.
Started hydral.
.
# RUE swelling - noted to have RUE swelling.  Ultrasound was
done which showed no evidence of DVT.
.
#  Nutrition -  He was started on po diet once he tolerated
trach mask. Speech and swallow were consulted for Passy Muir
Valve Evaluation, but pt was thought not to be safe to use it
due to his tracheal stenosis. Video swallow was performed on
[**2-29**] by speech and swallow who recommended that he can take
Regular diet with thin liquids.  Soup and cereals should be
avoided however.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25582**] was admitted on [**10-31**] and underwent a
mitral valve replacment with a pericardial thermafix valve. The
operation was uneventful and she was brought CSRU on minimal
inotropic support. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. She weaned from pressort support
without difficulty. By postoperative day one, she experienced
oliguria and developed acute respiratory distress which required
reintubation. The renal service was consulted and recommended to
hold cyclosporine and continue Lasix trials. Her creatinine
peaked to 3.9. Her acute on chronic renal failure was attributed
to acute tubular necrosis. K+ levels remained within normal
limits and there was no inidication to proceed with
hemodialysis. Over the next several days, she gradually
responded to Lasix drip. By postoperative day three, she was
re-extubated. She was concomitantly started on Amiodarone for
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. She otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm. She
was gradually transitioned to oral Lasix and transferred to the
SDU on postoperative day five. Due to poor IV access, the
central venous line was left in place and changed appropriately.
She continued to remain mostly in a normal sinus rhythm,
tolerating beta blockade and Amiodarone. Her renal function
continued to improve. Cyclosporine was eventually continued on
postooperative day 7.
She continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for
discharge on postoperative day 10. At discharge, her oxygen
saturations were 95% with the chest x-ray showing ****. Her
heart rate was in sinus rhythm and blood pressure was well
controlled. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and intact.

gentamycin for the first 48 hours of life for rule out
sepsis.  Blood cultures remained negative and thus
antibiotics were discontinued after two days.  The infant has
not required subsequent course of IV antibiotics.  She did
develop purulent eye discharge for which she received five
days of erythromycin ointment from day of life 28 to day of
life 33.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1242**]
Chief Complaint:
elective admission for vancomycin desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Vancomycin desensitization

History of Present Illness:
42F with a history of recurrent pyelonephitis and multiple drug
sensitivities who was directly admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
vancomycin desensitization for an Enterococcal UTI. She reports
that starting approximately a week ago she began having urinary
frequency and malaise consistent with past UTIs. About 5 days
ago she was seen in [**Company 191**]. A UA at that time was bland, but grew
Enterococcus spp. She continued to feel unwell and began to
develop fevers and chills. By Monday she was starting to have L
CVA tenderness. She was again seen in [**Company 191**]. Her UA remained
notable for 1WBC and 3 RBC and her UCx grew Enterococcus. She
continued to feel increasingly unwell and was seen today by her
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had significant L CVAT and urinary frequency as well as
chills and subjective fevers. Her PCP was concerned about her
progressive pyelonephritis and arranged admission directly from
clinic. Of note, the patient has significant phlebitis with PIVs
and is a difficult access, so it was decided that the antibiotic
regimen with the least frequent dosing would be advantegeous for
her clinically. Ultimately it was decided that she should be
directly admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for vancomycin desensitization and
then treatment for 10 to 14 days with [**Hospital1 **] vancomycin over QID
ampicillin.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she has significant L CVAT and subjective fevers.
She received an IV infusion of morphine sulphate and promptly
had a reaction to with with hives speading up her arm. She
received diphenhydramine 25mg IV and betamethasone TP for this
and felt better. Pharmacy was consulted and given the [**Hospital1 112**]
protocol for vancomycin desensitization to use over the [**Hospital1 18**]
protocol as she has tolerated the [**Hospital1 112**] protocols better in the
past.

Past Medical History:
# Multiple drug allergies including likely [**Initials (NamePattern4) 22721**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
Syndrome associated with fluconazole desensitization. Also,
severe phlebitis with PICCs, milder phlebitis with conventional
IV catheters if left indwelling
# CVID - monthly IVIG
# History of recurrent pyelonephritis
# autonomic neuropathy - on IVIG primarily for neuropathy but
also CVID.
# esophageal dysmotility
# oral/genital ulcers ? Behcet's
# colonic inertia s/p subtotal colectomy at [**Hospital3 14659**] in [**2093**]

# atrophic vaginitis with recurrent yeast infections
# sleep disorder characterized by non-REM narcolepsy, restless
leg
syndrome, and periodic leg movements

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94828**] is a 42F with a history of recurrent pyelonephitis and
multiple drug sensitivities who was directly admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for vancomycin desensitization for an Enterococcal UTI.
Ultimately it was decided that she should be directly admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for vancomycin desensitization and then treatment
for 10 to 14 days with [**Hospital1 **] vancomycin over QID ampicillin.
.
1. Enterococcus UTI: Sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin.
Given the need for a 14 day course, the patient cannot
conveniently manage multiple daily [**Hospital1 4319**] of ampicillin, so she
will have to use vancomycin. Her allergist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 21734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
at [**Hospital1 112**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 21743**]) has forwarded a desensitization protocol
for vancomycin for her. The protocol was completed, and the
patient will remain on IV Vancomycin [**Hospital1 **].  Given difficult
logistics of administering vancomycin at q 12 hr dosing and need
for inpatient admission for administration over the weekend, she
was admitted for inpt stay through the weekend.  Her CT Abdomen
showed no hydronephrosis and no perinephric
abscess.
.
Throughout the hospitalization her symptoms improved. Her flank
pain lessened and she remained afebrile.  On the day of
discharge the patient developed temperature of 100.1.  She was
asymptomatic, and generally looked well.  Urine and blood
cultures were sent and she was sent home with instructions to
monitor her temperature every six hours.  Ms. [**Known lastname 94828**] will
continue to receive vancomycin treatment at her outpatient
[**Known lastname **] unit.
.
2. Elevated creatinine: During the hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 94829**]
creatinine increased from 0.8 to 1.2.  This occurred the day
after she had an episode of diarrhea and was likely
multifactorial secondary to both dehydration due to the diarrhea
and from the vancomycin.  She received several fluid boluses.
She was sent home with instructions to have her creatinine
re-checked at her [**Known lastname **] unit on [**7-25**].
.
3.  Diarrhea: Ms. [**Known lastname 94828**] had several episodes of diarrhea during
her admission.  C. Diff was sent and was negative.  Her symptoms
improved prior to discharge.
.
4. CVID: Ms. [**Known lastname 94828**] was scheduled for [**Known lastname **] on [**2101-7-20**]. Held
secondary to infection.

Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Unable to obtain as on ventilator
Obtained history from nursing home records. Called both
HCP/guardians but unable to reach. Patient unable to provide
history as has developmental disabilities with good receptive
language skills but non-verbal due to presence of tracheostomy
placed on [**2111-1-13**].
54F MR, tracheomalacia s/p tracheostomy in [**2107**], PVD, multiple
aspiration pneumonias, DM2 among other conditions who had low
oxygen saturations at her nursing facility. She was noted to
have thick yellow secretions from her trach tube on [**2112-8-9**].
She was started on zithromax. It was noted that today her pulse
ox was low in 70s-80s on supplemental oxygen with no improvement
with suction today. She was tremulous and bluish. She was
transferred to the ER for further care.
Of note, the patient has tracheomalacia. She was hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of severe PVD in Feburary [**2110**] at which
time she went into respiratory distress from pulmonary edema.
Adequate intubation was not possible due to tracheomalacia, and
she underwent open tracheostomy. She stabilized but remained
ventilator dependent for severe week but eventually weaned at
pulmonary rehab. Because of tracheomalacia and subsequent trauma
from tracheostomy (Portex #7), she will likely remain
teacheostomy dependent and not a candidate for decannulation.
Per the IP team, she is not a candidate for a PM valve.
At baseline, she receives continuous humidifcation via trach
mask and large volume nebulizer. The FiO2 settings is from 21-40
% to keep O2 sat > 90 %.
The patient also has a history of bipolar disorder with a long
history of mood swings including agitation, assault, and
depression.

She was given vancomycin, zosyn, and levaquin.
Access was difficult with 20G peripheral IV in shoulder and
failed attempt of right femoral line.
Patient was placed on a ventilator due to continued respiratory
distress and tachycardia. Vent settings were 350x20, PEEP 5,

Imaging:
[**2112-8-10**]
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy tube is appropriately
positioned.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
crowding.  The central pulmonary vessels are engorged, however,
no overt edema is seen.  There is no definite consolidation,
pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.

[**2112-8-15**]
Renal U/s
FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to patient body
habitus, edema and portable technique. The right kidney is 8.6
cm and the left kidney is 10.1 cm.  There is no obvious
hydronephrosis. We cannot evaluate for stones or masses. The
bladder is not seen.

[**2112-8-15**]
Chest CT
FINDINGS:  There are no pulmonary arterial filling defects to
suggest the
presence of pulmonary embolism.  There is no aortic dissection.
There are
small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions as well as
large areas of atelectasis bilaterally.  On the left, most of
the posterior basal segment is collapsed.  There are also
multiple areas of airspace consolidation consistent with
multifocal pneumonia.
  There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the
mediastinum.  The largest are a 19 x 12 mm right paratracheal
lymph node (3:19) and a 20 x 11 mm paraesophageal lymph node
further inferiorly (3:34).  Severe tracheomalacia is again
identified beginning just distal to the endotracheal tube and
continuing through the carina (3:10).  This is similar in extent
and severity to the prior examination from [**2112-4-13**].  No
focal osseous lesions are identified.  There is extensive
atherosclerotic calcification within the thoracic aorta and
coronary arteries.  A small pericardial effusion is present,
without evidence
of tamponade as well as a probable edematous lymph node in the
epicardial fat pad (4:112).

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia and segmental atelectasis, with small
bilateral
non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions.
3.  Severe tracheomalacia.
4.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive hypertrophy in
the setting of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
53F history of mental retardation, tracheomalacia s/p
tracheostomy with multiple aspiration pneumonias, DM2 among
other conditions who presented with tachypnea, increased oxygen
requirement, and thick secretions from tracheostomy concerning
for sepsis from a pulmonary source. Was found to have sputum
positive for pseudomonas and blood culture positive for E. Coli.
Both organisms were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

# Sepsis from a pulmonary and/or urinary source, initially
treated with broad coverage with vancomycin and cefepime.
Received fluid resuscitation. Initial lactate was 3.4, which
cleared with resuscitation. Pt. had episode of hypotension to
SBPs of 70s requiring placement of femoral CVC, and brief use of
NE for less than 24 hours. CVC was then pulled and a PICC line
was placed.

Blood Cx showed E. Coli, and suputum culture showed pseudomonas,
both of which were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. When this data
was obtained, antibiotic coverage was narrowed to just
ciprofloxacin. As patient was also on large doses of seroquel,
EKG was obtained, which showed normal QTc.

She is to continue a 15 day course of antibiotic coverage for
pseudomonas VAP/E. Coli bacteremia with ciprofloxacin. End date
for cipro is [**2112-8-25**].

# Respiratory failure
Patient may have respiratory failure secondary to pulmonic
process such as pneumonia or tracheobronchitis with some
component of mucous plugging per reports in ER. Pt. was able to
be weaned off the vent, saturating well with trach mask. The
evening before discharge she was placed on pressure support
ventilation to see if this would improve her tachycardia. She
was able to come off of vent on day of discharge. Would likely
benefit from CPAP at night and albuterol nebulizer.

# Anemia: Likely multifactorial ACD, acute blood loss, and
dilutional. Admitted at baseline Hgb ~ 10. Crit dropped after
placement of fem line with bleeding noted at fem site, concern
for retroperitoneal bleed at that time but responded
appropriately to 4 units with no evolving signs of bleeding.
Remained stable, then dropped two days later in context of 2L
fluid bolus, bumped appropriately to 2 units PRBC. Hematocrit
stable at discharge.

# Altered mental status: Patient waxed and waned. Initially
attributed to sepsis and respiratory distress, the patient was
eventually decreased on Seroquel from 250mg TID to 125mg TID.
She became alert and oriented at discharge.

# Tachycardia: Etiology unclear, developed tachycardia to 120's
after sepsis resolved. Responded to CPAP at night, IVF, and
resumption home metoprolol.

# Rash: Likely drug reaction to cefepime-erythematous blanching
over abd and torso, nonpruritic, no swelling, no pustules,
evolved two days after cefepime started and one day after vanc
DC'd. Rash resolved with narrowing to ciprofloxacin. The patient
had some relief with hydrocortisone cream.

# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia, admitted Na 130, rose
to 141 with IVF.

Chronic Issues:
# Peripheral Vascular Disease: Lower extremity pulses are
evidence by doppler on admission. Continued ASA 325 mg PO qD,
held fenofibrate, restarted at discharge.

# Bipolar disorder
She had no active signs or symptoms of psychiatric
decompensation. Continued seroquel 250 mg PO TID initially, then
decreased to 125mg TID in the setting of altered mental status.
Continued valproic acid syrup 500 mg PO qAM and 750 mg PO qPM.

# DM2: Blood sugars were stable, Lantus decreased from 48 to 35
units at bed time.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine

# Hypertension: After sepsis resolved, pressures stabilized.

# Glaucoma: Continued latanoprost drops qAM

# Osteoporosis: Continued calcium and vitamin D after sepsis
stabilized

-ventilator support as needed, may trial CPAP at night
-IV ciprofloxacin administration until [**2112-8-25**]
-wound care for buttocks and inner thighs
-Seroquel dose was downtitrated from home dose of 250mg TID to
50mg TID while in hospital.  Patient did well on this dose and
on discharge was not agitated.  If agitated, may uptitrate dose
of seroquel as needed if there is no QTc prolongation
-Monitor hemodynamics: if tachycardic and blood pressure
tolerates, please restart metoprolol and uptitrate as needed
(this had been held in the hospital due to hypotension and
concern for sepsis; her home dose prior to hospitalization was
150mg [**Hospital1 **])
-Speech & swallow evaluation:
1.  Pt is not safe to wear the PMV at this time
2.  Discuss safety of trach cuff deflation trials to allow
intermittent periods where pt can try to speak
3.  Remain NPO with tube feeds
4.  Q4 oral care as pt allows

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Final Report
AP CHEST, 12:48 A.M., [**6-22**]
HISTORY: Chest tube pulled, evaluate for pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-21**]:
Following removal of endotracheal, nasogastric, midline drainage
and pleural tubes, there is more atelectasis at the lung bases,
cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly larger, there is very
pronounced gaseous distention of the stomach, and no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. A small region of
atelectasis at the left lung base reflects the previous
placement of the chest tube. [**Known firstname 1439**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was paged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 13393**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization,
which revealed triple vessel disease. She had intact LV function
by echocardiogram.  On [**6-21**] she went to the Operating Room where
bypass grafting.  Please see the OR report for details, in
summary she had coronary bypass grafting x5 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the first
diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein double
sequential graft from aorta to the first obtuse marginal and
second obtuse marginal coronary arteries; as well as reverse
saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
artery. His bypass time was 97 minutes with a crossclamp of 81
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the OR to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. He
remained hemodynamically stable, woke neurologically intact, was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated. On POD1 he was
transferred from the cardiac surgery ICU to the stepdown floor
in stable condition. All tubes lines and drains were remover per
cardiac surgery protocol
Once on the stepdown floor the patient worked with nursing and
physical therapy to increase mobility and strength.  The
remainder of her hospital course was uneventful. ON POD4 she was
discharged to rehabilitation at Island Terrace in [**Location 942**],MA.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 80053**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2155-10-21**] after being struck
by a car.  She was evaluated by the orthopaedic and trauma
surgery services.  She was found to have a right open proximal
tibia fracture, a left open distal tibia fracture, bilateral
inferior pubic rami fracture, a right sacral body fracture, a
small left pneumothorax, and bilateral pulmonary contusions.
She was admitted to the T/SICU for further monitoring, and later
that day she was taken to the operating room and underwent an
I&D with ORIF of her right proximal tibia fracture and an I&D
with external fixator placement and cement spacer of the left
open distal tibia fracture.  She tolerated the procedures well,
was extubated transferred to the T/SICU for further monitoring.
Her cervical collar was cleared by trauma surgery.  On [**2155-10-23**]
she was transferred from the T/SICU to the floor.  On [**2155-10-24**]
she was transfused with 4 units of packed red blood cells due to
acute blood loss anemia.  On [**2155-10-26**] she was transferred to the
care of the orthopaedic surgery service. The patient was being
followed by physical therapy for out of bed transfers. Physical
therapy recommended that the patient go to a rehab facility upon
discharge. The rest of her hospital stay was uneventful with her
lab data and vital signs within normal limits and her pain
controlled. She is being discharged today in stable condition.

The patient is to return to the orthopaedics clinic on [**11-6**], [**2154**] for evaluation of her injuries and her external
fixation device. On that clinic visit it will be determined what
type of surgical intervention will be necessary as well as the
potential date of the surgery. The patient will likely return to
[**Hospital 1319**] Rehab for ongoing care s/p surgery.

IMAGES/ STUDIES:
================

CXRAY ON [**2188-12-29**]:
INDINGS: Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. A
dialysis
catheter projects over the right atrium, unchanged. The right
PICC tip is not seen beyond the junction of the right
brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. There is no focal
consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal, allowing
for low lung volumes.

IMPRESSION: Right PICC tip is not seen beyond the junction of
the right
brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.

EGD on [**12-27**]
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:  Excavated Lesions A single bleeding ulcer was found in
the stomach. There was a visible vessel. Three endoclips were
successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.

Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

REPEAT EGD ON [**2188-12-31**]:

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yo female with dCHF, ESRD on HD on plavix and
aspirin who was admitted to the MICU for emergent EGD with with
hypotension, melena and +NG lavage, found to have a bleeding
gastric ulcer which was clipped and is now stable.
.
.
# Upper GI bleed: Pt had a bleeding ulcer that had 2 clips
placed. She also received a total of 2 units of PRBCs on [**12-27**]
but has not required any additional blood transfusion since
then. She was on Plavix and ASA given that she has prior stents
for PAD and recent TMA. Her GI bleed was likely aggravated by to
Plavix/Aspirin use. Her Hpylori serology was negative, so this
is unlikely. Pt had two episodes of melanotic stools on [**12-30**],
last one early in the afternoon. She remains HD stable and Hct
is stable in the high 20s. So, this was discussed with GI and
she was taken back to have an EGD on [**12-31**] given that she would
need to be restarted on plavix and ASA. On the repeat EGD there
was no bleeding noted on the gastric ulcer and clips appeared in
place. There is another non-bleeding ulcer seen on the stomach.
GI's recommendation is to continue to hold the ASA and plavix at
this time until she is re-evaluated by GI on Tues of next week
given that her risk of rebleeding is high. This was discussed
with the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] team who states that her risk of bleeding
outweighs her risk of clotting at this time and she should be
restarted on ASA and plavix as GI thinks this is safe. She will
follow in the [**Hospital **] clinic on Tues of next week and she will need
to have blood counts checked every other day until then with
results sent to her PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) **] hospital as noted on the
d/c instructions.
- continue protonix 40mg Q12 PO
- Diet as tolerated
- hold aspirin and plavix until further indicated by GI
- Check Hct every other day and have results sent to [**Hospital 1459**]
hospital as noted above
- She will also need to be close monitor for bleeding:
dark/black tarry stools and coffee ground emesis
.
# C diff colitis: This was confirmed with rehab facility that
patient had diarrhea and positive C. Diff toxin and should be on
PO Vanco until [**1-1**]. Patient has had no bowel movements today.

- Continue vancomycin PO until [**1-1**]
- monitor for diarrhea
.
# Recent PNA: No cough or leukocytosis. She is breathing
comfortably, and has scat crackles on Left base. She had one
episode of fever with temp up to 100.7 on [**12-29**], but no
leukocytosis and no other symptoms. She has been afebrile since
then. Patient completed PNA ABX.
.
# Elevated troponins: CE now trending down. Her CE were elevated
in the setting of ESRD as well as some possible demand ischemia
from bleed and hypotension. PAtient denies chest pain and there
are no ischemic EKG changes so not ACS. Her CE started to trend
down and she has no other c/o
.
# Hypertension: Pt was initially hypotensive in the setting of
bleeding and on [**12-29**] after having HD her SBP was 200. She was
then restarted slowly on her home dose of antihypertensives. As
per pt, she is on 40mg of lisinopril and as per discharge paper
work from prior admission she was on 10mg Qday. She was given
one dose of lisinopril 40mg on [**12-30**] which was changed to 10mg
after confirming with her rehab facility. Her Carvedilol was
restarted on [**12-31**] and her amlodipine can be restart if her BP
remains stable and SBP remains above 100. For now she is
normotensive.
- Cont on lisinopril 10mg Qday and on carvedilol 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
- Restart on Amlodipine if BP remains stable and SBP>100
.
.
# Hypothyroidism:
-cont levothyroxine
.
# ESRD: on HD [**Name (NI) 12075**], Pt had HD on [**12-29**] and on [**12-31**] and has
tolerated well. She does not appear to be fluid overloaded at
this time.
- [**Month/Year (2) 12075**] HD
- Dialysis fellow recs

# Diabetes mellitus type II: She was initially hypoglycemic in
the setting of being NPO which has now resolved
-humalog sliding scale while in the hospital
.
.
# Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease: Recent TMA. R foot appears to be
healing well. Her surgical incision site looks well approximated
with sutures. She will be following up with the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] clinic
on [**1-17**].
- Holding ASA, clopidogrel given GI bleed
- continue simvastatin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 76499**],

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. You were
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] after having a gastric
bleed. You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit
and you had 2 units of red blood cells. You also have an
endoscopy that showed that you had a bleeding ulcer in your
stomach. You had 3 clips placed on the ulcer to stop the
bleeding. You have done well and your blood counts have remained
stable. We think that the aspirin and the plavix have
contributed to your bleeding. These medications were stopped
while you were in the hospital and you will be restarting then
after being evaluated by the gastroenterologist next week. This
was decided since your risk for bleeding outweighs your risk of
forming clots.  The [**Hospital1 1106**] team agrees with this decision and
you have an appointment with them in [**Month (only) **] as listed below.

We have made the following changes to your medication:
- STOP taking aspirin and plavix until you see the
gastroenterologist and have further recommendations from them
- START protonix twice daily
- Some of your medications for your blood pressure were held
while your in the hospital due to your bleeding and have been
added back slowly. You should be restarted on amlodipine 10 mg
daily if your SBP remains >100

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 60939**] is a 52-year-old
gentleman with a history of aortic valve endocarditis, and he
was hospitalized approximately 6 weeks. The cause was
unknown, and the organism was unknown, but he had recovered
well until about 7 to 8 months ago. He had been starting to
experience worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion. Echocardiography showed LVH, an ejection fraction
of 55% to 60%, a calcified aortic valve with aortic stenosis
and aortic insufficiency. He was referred to Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **].
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diverticulosis.
2. Status post colon resection in [**2179**] due to diverticulitis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Psoriasis on his lower extremities.
5. Aortic valve endocarditis.


ALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Enalapril 20 mg p.o. once a day,
aspirin 81 mg p.o. once a day, Afrin nasal spray p.r.n., and
over-the-counter medication for psoriasis.

RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  Preoperative carotid studies
showed a 30% to 49% right internal carotid stenosis and less
than 30% on the left.

A preoperative chest x-ray showed no evidence of any acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality. Please refer to the official
report dated [**2194-5-28**].

A preoperative EKG showed a sinus rhythm at 83 with some LVH
and secondary ST-T changes. Please refer to the official
report dated [**2194-5-28**].

A preoperative cardiac catheterization report was not
available at the time of this dictation. Per the patient, he
had right coronary artery disease.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 8.1,
hematocrit was 34.9, and platelet count was 348.000. PT was
13.4, PTT was 28.7, and INR was 1.1. Urinalysis was negative.
Sodium was 140, K was 4.6, chloride was 106, bicarbonate was
30, BUN was 17, creatinine was 1.1, with a blood sugar of
112. ALT was 42, AST was 20, alkaline phosphatase was 63,
amylase was 53, total bilirubin was 0.4, lipase was 30.
Magnesium was 2.0. HbA1C was 5.6%. Urine culture was also
negative.

HABITS:  He denied any tobacco use and rare use of alcohol.
His last dental visit was approximately 1 year prior with no
problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He was in sinus
tachycardia at 105, with a temperature of 99.2, a blood
pressure of 132/74, a respiratory rate of 18, and saturating
94 percent on room air. He was awake, and anxious, and
oriented x 3. He had a grossly nonfocal neurologic exam. His
heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a harsh grade 4/6
systolic ejection murmur that radiated to his carotids. His
lungs were clear with faint wheezes. He had positive bowel
sounds. His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended,
and obese, with a well-healed surgical scar from his
colectomy. His extremities had 1+ edema with right lower
extremity psoriatic plaques. He had 2+ femoral pulses
bilaterally without any bruits heard on his right side, 2+
popliteal, 2+ DP and PT and radial pulses on the right, and
1+ DP and PT pulses on the left, with 2+ radial on the left.
On exam later in the day he was noted to have mild bilateral
rales as well as the elevated blood sugar that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
deemed to be undiagnosed diabetes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted for management of his
congestive heart failure with a plan to do surgery the
following morning. On [**5-29**], he underwent aortic valve
replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a 25-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
valve. The right coronary artery was nondominant and unable
to be grafted. Postoperative TEE showed an ejection fraction
of 50%, no AI, and 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] did go to the cardiothoracic ICU
on a nitroglycerin drip at 0.2 mcg/kg per minute, a propofol
drip at 15 mcg/kg per minute, and an insulin drip at 2 units
per hour. He was AV paced at the time.

On postoperative day 1, he had a cardiac index of 2.7, in
sinus rhythm at 93, with a blood pressure of 124/76. He was
alert and oriented. He had been extubated. His Swan was
removed. His chest tubes were removed. His Lopressor beta
blockade was begun. He remained on an insulin drip as well as
nitroglycerin at 1.25.

On postoperative day 2, the patient showed third-degree AV
block. His Lopressor was stopped. He continued to be
hemodynamically stable. He was started on captopril at 12.5
and began Lasix diuresis. The electrophysiology service was
consulted. He had an underlying sinus rhythm with junctional
rate also. He alternated between sinus and a junctional rate
at approximately 40 beats per minute.

On postoperative day 4, his Lasix was increased. His Foley
catheter was discontinued. He started a heparin drip. His
Coumadin was held pending his EP consult in case it was
determined that he would need a pacemaker, and he was
transferred out to the floor to begin working with nurses and
the physical therapist. EP evaluated him and determined that
his third-degree heart block and junctional rhythm would
require a pacemaker. His heparin was turned off on the
morning on postoperative day 5. He continued on captopril and
continued with aspirin and Imdur. His exam was unremarkable,
and he continued to have a temporary pacemaker prior to his
pacemaker placement on the 25th in the catheterization
laboratory which he had done successfully.

On postoperative day 6, he seemed to have tolerated his
pacemaker well. His temporary pacing wires were removed. He
was restarted on his heparin as well as Lopressor. He was
seen by case management and continued to work with the nurse
and physical therapist on increasing his exercise tolerance
and ambulating activity. The pacemaker was checked and
interrogated by the EP service with a confirmatory chest x-
ray also. He was receiving Percocet for sternal incisional
pain. His heparin was increased on postoperative day 6. He
received his first dose of Coumadin on [**6-4**]. He continued
with beta blockade with metoprolol 25 twice a day, and his
creatinine was stable at 0.9. His baseline INR was 1.1 prior
to his first dose of Coumadin. His sternum was stable. The
incisions were clean, dry, and intact. His pacer incision was
clean, dry, and intact. He had no extremity edema. He was
encouraged to increase his activity level with physical
therapy and that he would be able to be discharged to home
with VNA services as soon as his INR was therapeutic. Over
the course of the next several days he continued his
ambulation and continued to improve. He was dosed with
Coumadin every evening.

On postoperative day 8, his INR rose to 1.2. His Imdur was
discontinued as well as captopril being changed over to
lisinopril. His heparin was increased to 1400 units per hour
when his INR only rose from 1.1 to 1.2.

On postoperative day 9 and postoperative day 4 from his
pacemaker, he did a level V and was cleared by physical
therapy. He had a short run of a question of SVT versus AFib
which self terminated. He had scattered rhonchi and a sharp
click from his mechanical valve. His pacer site had no
hematoma. His Coumadin was increased to 7.5 mg that evening.
His enalapril was increased to 10 mg. On the 1st, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
determined that once his INR reached 1.8 he could be
discharged home on his Coumadin with followup with his
primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] postoperative day 9, his INR rose
to 1.7.

On [**6-8**], on the day of discharge, his PT rose to 16.7 with
an INR of 1.8; and it was determined that he could be
discharged to home with VNA services with follow-up blood
draws at [**Hospital3 35813**] Center in [**Location (un) 37361**], [**Doctor Last Name **],
his home town, the following Monday.

Social history notable for adoption x 1; denies illicit drug use. Family history is non-contributory.

Antenatal Hx - [**Last Name (un) **] [**2148-2-26**] for EGA 35-2/7 weeks at delivery this evening at [**2066**]. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus treated with Humulin; by methadone use as above; and by IUGR and non-reassuring fetal heart rate, leading to repeat cesarean section under epidural and spinal anesthesia. There was no labor. ROM occurred at delivery and yielded clear amniotic fluid. There was no intrapartum fever or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis and intrapartum antibiotics were not administered.

Neonatal course - Infant was vigorous at delivery. She was orally and nasally bulb suctioned and dried, adn was subsequently pink and in no distress in room air. Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes. ROS otherwise negative/non-contributory

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 72 year old
female status post emergent coronary artery bypass graft
times two secondary to catheterization complicated by
asystole and hypotension, who was transferred recently from
rehabilitation for management of a pericardial effusion.  The
patient was admitted in [**2153-11-20**] for an elective
catheterization at which time the procedure was complicated
by a perforation with subsequent ST elevations, asystole, and
placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump and emergent
coronary artery bypass graft times two.  The patient was
managed at [**Hospital1 69**] and then
discharged to [**Hospital6 310**] on [**2153-12-19**].

At rehabilitation, the patient has progressed very poorly
with persistent fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, tachypnea, as
well as persistent pleural effusion.  As part of her work-up,
an echocardiogram was obtained on [**1-3**], which revealed a
significant pericardial effusion as well as a reported right
atrial compression and the patient was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

Upon admission to the hospital, the patient was taken
immediately to catheterization.  Tamponade was suggested by
equalization of the RA, right ventricular end diastolic
pressure, and wedge pressures of approximately 15; 400 cc of
serosanguinous fluid was drained from the pericardial space
with resolution of normal pressures.

Following the procedure, the patient was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit, for observation.  On arrival to the
Cardiac Care Unit, the patient was without any complaints of
shortness of breath and did not report any significant chest
discomfort.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Emergent coronary artery bypass graft times two in
[**11/2153**], secondary to catheterization complicated by
perforation after diagnosis of 99% left anterior descending,
normal circumflex, non-critical right coronary artery.
Course was complicated by ST elevations and subsequent
asystole during the catheterization, placement of an
intra-aortic balloon pump and subsequent emergent coronary
artery bypass graft times two (SVG to the left anterior
descending and obtuse marginal).

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Fentanyl patch 25 micrograms applied to skin and change
q. 72 hours.
8.  Percocet, one tablet p.o. q. four to six hours p.r.n.
break through pain.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Cantonese speaking female
with a very involved family who lives locally.  She denies
any past history of smoking or alcohol use.  She was
transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs were temperature 99.5 F.;
heart rate 102; blood pressure 108/56; respiratory rate 20;
saturating 94% on room air.  Weight 46.9 kilograms.  In
general, awake, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equally
round and reactive to light.  Moist mucous membranes.  Neck:
Jugular venous pressure at 10 cm.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Chest wall:
Thoracotomy scar clean, dry and intact.  Pigtail catheter
intact without erythema.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with scant crackles and decreased breath sounds
at bilateral bases, left greater than right.  Abdomen:
Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  One plus pitting edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.8, hematocrit 32.5,
platelets 327.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.9, chloride 97,
bicarb 30, BUN 15, creatinine 1.3.  PT 12.8, PTT 26.2, INR
1.1.

Arterial blood gases:  7.44/40/60.

Chest x-ray:  Left pleural effusion, pneumopericardium, no
obvious infiltrates.  Mild congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 72 year old female status
post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2153-11-20**], who was admitted for pericardial effusion with evidence
of cardiac tamponade on catheterization status post drainage
of the effusion and placement of a pigtail catheter.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient recently underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times two approximately two and
a half weeks prior to the time of admission.  She was
continued on her aspirin therapy, however, her Plavix was
held given the serosanguinous fluid that was removed from the
pericardial space.  In addition, her beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were also held as the patient was mildly
hypotensive at the time of admission, and these were titrated
back as tolerated.  The patient had no complaints of chest
pain and no suggestion of anginal symptoms over the course of
the hospital stay.

The patient had her pericardial sac effectively drained
during the catheterization and secondary to placement of
pigtail catheter.  Over the first two hospital days, the
drainage from the catheter slowly decreased in quantity.  An
echocardiogram was obtained on Hospital day number four,
which demonstrated near complete resolution of the
pericardial effusion with fibrin formation, suggestive of
early consolidation.  Since the drain put out less than 50 cc
in the 24 hours prior to this time, the pigtail catheter was
removed without difficulty and the patient subsequently felt
subjectively less short of breath and complained of less
pain.  The patient's blood pressure remained stable over the
remainder of the hospital stay.

Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were added back to her
medication regimen and titrated up as tolerated.  An
echocardiogram was obtained on [**2154-1-7**], for evaluation of
the pericardial effusion which, in addition, demonstrated a
normal left atrium and left ventricle, small remnant of a
pericardial effusion and ejection fraction of 70%.

The patient's Lasix and Aldactone were held at time of
admission secondary to feeling that the patient was likely on
the dry side.  Her fluid status was monitored closely over
the hospital stay.  As the patient begins to take more p.o.
input, she will likely need titration of her Lasix back to
her usual outpatient dose.  In addition, the patient was
maintained in Telemetry and demonstrated normal sinus rhythm
with only occasional PCV's on Telemetry throughout the
hospital stay.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have persistent
pleural effusions, which are likely secondary to her coronary
artery bypass graft performed approximately two weeks prior
to the time of admission.  Consideration was given to a
thoracentesis, however, the patient maintained excellent
oxygen saturations, a normal arterial blood gas and had no
complaints of shortness of breath or respiratory discomfort
once the pigtail catheter was removed.  Since the fluid
surrounding the lung space is likely similar to the fluid
surrounding the pericardial space, it was not felt warranted
to perform a thoracentesis for diagnostic purposes since
Chemistry and Culture data were to be obtained from the

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and
abdominal distension and had a CT scan which showed an abdominal
fluid collection. You were started on antibiotics and we would
like you to continue to take Cipro and Flagyl for 2 weeks.
Please take all antibiotics as prescribed. Call or return to
emergency department for fever greater then 101, severe nausea,
vomiting dehydration and being unable to maintain oral
hydration, pain > 24 hrs and unresolved, redness or purulent
drainage to the incision, shortness of breath or chest pains.
You had difficulty urinating after your foley catheter was
removed and urology were consulted who recommended placement of
a foley catheter for 5 days and to follow-up with your primary
care provider or urologist for a voiding trial.
We would like you to continue taking Prednisone 10 mg twice a
day and follow-up with your endocrinologist for steroid
tapering. Your blood sugars were elevated during your
hospitalization and your insulin was adjusted by the
endocrinologist. Please follow up with your endocrinologist for
further monitoring of your blood sugars and insulin adjustment.
Please continue to monitor your ileostomy. The most common
complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The
output from the stoma is stool from the small intestine and the
water content is very high. The stool is no longer passing
through the large intestine which is where the water from the
stool is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed.
You must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks.
The output from the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less
than 500cc. If you find that your output has become too much or
too little, please call the office for advice. Keep yourself
well hydrated, if you notice your ileostomy output increasing,
take in more electrolyte drink such as gatoraide. Please monitor
yourself for signs and symptoms of dehydration including:
dizziness (especially upon standing), weakness, dry mouth,
headache, or fatigue. If you notice these symptoms please call
the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if
these symptoms are severe.


Followup Instructions:
Primary care provider [**Name Initial (PRE) 263**]/ Coumadin dosing in 1 week.
Urologist for removal of foley and voiding trial.
Gastroenterologist regarding steroid tapering.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 6 weeks [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU and was transfused 2 units
of PRBS's. Post-transfusion hematocrit remained stable around
30. A CT scan was obtained on hospital day #2, which showed a
small-to-moderate amount of high density fluid which most likely
represented blood around the liver and the spleen and the right
kidney, with
adjacent perinephric fluid/hematoma. The origin of bleeding was
not definitively identified, but bleeding could potentially have
been arising in the kidney given the history of recent renal
surgery and history of hematuria. No active extravasation was
identified. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout
his stay in the MICU, and was transferred to the floor on HD#2.
A repeat CT on hospital day #3 showed no active changes from the
previous scan. On HD#4, the patient appeared more distended,
though he continued to pass flatus. A KUB was obtained, which
showed no signs of obstruction. An MRI urogram was also

IMAGING:
CTA [**12-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Right internal carotid arteriogram confirming
successful clip
occlusion of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm and a
right posterior communicating artery aneurysm. There is no
evidence of residual aneurysmal filling

CT Head [**12-1**]:
Mild cerebral edema. Expected post-surgical changes after
craniotomy and
craniectomy with extra-axial pneumocephalus and small amount of
blood
products

Angiogram [**12-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
No residual filling of the clipped A-comm.
Possible small neck filling of the clipped R P-comm aneurysm.
Minimal narrowing of the right proximal MCA.
No occlusion or thrombosis of the right MCA.
Subtle hypodensity along the lateral aspect of the distal part
of the stent.

CT Head [**12-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Distribution of right frontoparietal acute infarct
is unchanged, but more prominent than on the prior study
consistent with evolving infarct.  No new areas of hypodensity
seen. No acute hemorrhage.

ECHO [**12-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No definite
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.

CT Head [**12-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontoparietal evolving infarct.
2. Stable post-craniectomy changes with stable small amount of
pneumocephalus
and small amount of blood products along right frontal vertex.
3. No new acute hemorrhage within limitation of artifact from
clip and
hardware.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] originally had a SAH in [**2119-1-13**] at that time he had an
AComm artery coiled, which later recanalized and expanded. A
second attempt at coiling
using a stent was not successful. The stent was placed in the
right A1 segment, with the proximal segment at the distal end of
the right ICA.
He was admitted on [**12-1**] for an elective clipping of the acomm
aneursym.

He underwent clipping on [**2119-12-1**]. A post operative angio showed
good positioning of the coil. The following morning he observed
to have left sided hemiplegia. CT
brain showed a large right superior division MCA infarct. He
also
had episodes of partial motor seizures involving his left
shoulder. He was placed on Keppra and Dilantin and continuos EEG
monitoring. A Echo showed no vegitation or abnormalities as a
cause for the stroke. On [**12-4**] a repeat CT showed further
changed distribution of edema/infarct in the right
frontoparietal lobes. No new areas of hypodensity seen with
slightly enlarged leftward shift. He was monitored closely in
the ICU he was continued on Plavix.

On [**12-6**] his serum Sodium was 133 and free water was restricted.
A CTP was ordered. On [**12-7**], the patient unexpectedly fell from
his ICU bed even with proper restraint, but did not suffer any
external injuries. A STAT head CT was obtained which showed no
abnormalities or acute changes.

The patient's exam improved on [**12-8**], and he was therefore
transfered to the step down unit.  He required a sitter for his
agitation, and he was started on ativan PRN. His mental status
gradually improved over the last 4 days he did not require any
sitter. His motor stength on his right side was [**5-17**]. His left
arm is plegic his left leg is approximately 4+/5 in the majority
of the muscle groups.  He was out of bed with PT/OT who
determined he would be a candidate for rehab. His last Dilantin
level was 14.3 on [**12-12**] he will continue on both Dilantin and
Keppra until follow-up.
Please watch the patient as he is starting to pick at his
incision. It is currently without break down or erythema.

Discharge Instructions:
General Instructions

??????	Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for
signs of infection.
??????	Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,
or excessive bending.
??????	You may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have
been removed. If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures,
you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
??????	You may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover
your head.
??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace)
while taking narcotic pain medication.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc.
??????	If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for
anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with
laboratory blood drawing in one week.  This can be drawn at your
PCP??????s office, but please have the results faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87**].
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will
not require blood work monitoring.
??????	Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at
your post-operative office visit.
??????	Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while
at home, unless you have been instructed not to.


Followup Instructions:
Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks.  Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4296**] for
